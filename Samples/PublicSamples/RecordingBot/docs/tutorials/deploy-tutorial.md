# Deploy Tutorial

In this tutorial we learn how to deploy the recording bot sample to a new AKS Cluster. We will also
set up a Recording Policy for all users within our Tenant and see the compliance redording banner
in our teams client.

## Prerequisites

- [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)
- [Powershell 7 as administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)
- [Git command line tool](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [AZ Azure command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows)
- [Helm command line tool](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl command line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/)
  - This tutorial also shows how to install kubectl with the azure command line tool
- [Microsoft Entra Id Tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant) [with Microsoft Teams users](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/license-users-groups)
- [Microsoft Azure Subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription)
  - The subscription in this tutorial is called `recordingbotsubscription`, also see [variables](#variables).
- Microsoft Entra Id adminstrator

The Microsoft Entra Id administrator is required to create recording policies and to approve
application permissions of the app registration. This tutorial assumes we are a Microsoft Entra Id
administrator and always log in as such unless the tutorial requires otherwise.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider to define own variable values before we start. Keep in mind the Azure resources have
> limitations for naming, read [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules) for reference. Some Values are automatically generated and
> can't be changed, but needs to be replaced with you're custom values.

If you encounter any problems during the tutorial, please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/lm-development/aks-sample/issues).
This means that the tutorial can be continuously expanded to include error handling.

Now let us start to [create an AKS cluster](./deploy/1-aks.md)
