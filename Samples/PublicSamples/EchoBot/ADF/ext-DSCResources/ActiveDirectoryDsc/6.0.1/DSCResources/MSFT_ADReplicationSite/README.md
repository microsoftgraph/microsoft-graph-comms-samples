# Description

The ADReplicationSite DSC resource will manage Replication Sites within Active Directory. Sites are used in Active Directory to either enable clients to discover network resources (published shares, domain controllers) close to the physical location of a client computer or to reduce network traffic over wide area network (WAN) links. Sites can also be used to optimize replication between domain controllers.

## Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
