# Description

The ADReplicationSiteLink DSC resource will manage Replication Site Links within Active Directory. A site link connects two or more sites. Site links reflect the administrative policy for how sites are to be interconnected and the methods used to transfer replication traffic. You must connect sites with site links so that domain controllers at each site can replicate Active Directory changes.

## Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
