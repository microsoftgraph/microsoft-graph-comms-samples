# Introduction

## About

The AudioVideoPlaybackBot sample guides you through building, deploying and testing an application hosted media bot. This sample demonstrates how a bot can do a video stream and change screen sharing role.

## Getting Started

This section walks you through the process of deploying and testing the sample bot.

### Bot Registration

1. Follow the steps in [Register Calling Bot](https://microsoftgraph.github.io/microsoft-graph-comms-samples/docs/articles/calls/register-calling-bot.html). Save the bot name, bot app id and bot secret for configuration.
    
2. Add the following Application Permissions to the bot:
    * `Calls.AccessMedia.All`
    * `Calls.Initiate.All`
    * `Calls.JoinGroupCall.All`
    * `Calls.JoinGroupCallAsGuest.All`

3. The permission needs to be consented by tenant admin. Go to https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=<app_id>&state=<any_number>&redirect_uri=<any_callback_url> using tenant admin to sign-in, then consent for the whole tenant..

### Prerequisites

* Install the prerequisites:
  *  [Visual Studio 2017+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  *  [PowerShell] 7.0+
  *  [Mirosoft Azure Subscription] (Can register for a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" target="_blank">free account</a>)
  *  [PostMan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop)

### Deploy

* Prerequisites for deploying Azure Cloud Services (extended support) [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services-extended-support/deploy-prerequisite).

#### Step 1: Securely Store Certificates with Azure Key Vault

Certificates are crucial for securing communication between your services. Azure Key Vault is used to store and manage these certificates securely.

Create an Azure Key Vault:
* Follow these instructions to create your Azure Key Vault: [Create Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal).

#### Step 2: Obtain and Configure Your SSL Certificate

To secure your service, you need a valid SSL certificate. Here’s how to obtain and configure it:

1. **Get a Wildcard Certificate**: 
   * Obtain a wildcard SSL certificate for your domain. For example, if your service is hosted at bot.contoso.com, get a certificate for \*.contoso.com. 
   * Ensure that the certificate is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and not self-signed.

2. **Upload to Azure Key Vault**:
   * Upload your SSL certificate to the Azure Key Vault. Follow these steps: [Import Certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-import-certificate?tabs=azure-portal).

3. **Get the Thumbprint**:
   * Copy the certificate thumbprint from Azure Key Vault. You will need to add this thumbprint to your `.cscfg` (cloud service configuration) and `.csdef` (cloud service definition) files.

   1. Update the Certificate section in your `.cscfg` file with the thumbprint.
   ```xml
    <Certificates>
     <!-- Certificate Configuration:
     This is where you specify the thumbprint for your SSL certificate.
     Replace 'YOUR_THUMBPRINT' with the actual thumbprint of your certificate. -->
    <Certificate name="MySSLCertificate" thumbprint="YOUR_THUMBPRINT" thumbprintAlgorithm="sha1" />
   </Certificates>
   ```

   2. Update the Certificate element in your `.csdef` file.
   ```xml
    <Certificates>
    <Certificate name="YourCertificateName" storeLocation="LocalMachine" storeName="My" />
    </Certificates>
   ```
   * Replace YourCertificateName with the actual name of your certificate as it appears in your Azure Key Vault or wherever it is stored. Here are the key attributes:
   
 **name**: This should match the certificate's name as referenced in your Azure Key Vault or local certificate store.

 **storeLocation**: Specifies where the certificate is stored. LocalMachine is a common location for certificates installed on the local machine.

 **storeName**: Specifies the store name where the certificate is located. My is a common store name used for personal certificates.


#### Step 3: Define Your Virtual Network

* For Azure Extended Services, you can define the virtual network and subnet configurations in your `.cscfg` file. Azure can create the virtual network during the service setup if it doesn't already exist.
* When deploying your cloud service (extended) in Azure, virtual network and subnet configurations are managed automatically based on your .cscfg file. Follow these guidelines to ensure proper configuration.

##### Using Existing Virtual Network:

*  If you have an existing Virtual Network (VNet) that you want to use:

```xml
<NetworkConfiguration>
  <VirtualNetworkSite name="YourExistingVNetName" />
  <AddressAssignments>
    <InstanceAddress roleName="AVPWorkerRole">
      <Subnets>
        <Subnet name="YourExistingSubnetName" />
      </Subnets>
    </InstanceAddress>
  </AddressAssignments>
</NetworkConfiguration>
```
*  Replace "YourExistingVNetName" with the name of your existing Virtual Network and "YourExistingSubnetName" with the name of your existing subnet within that Virtual Network.

##### Automatic Creation of Virtual Network:

*  If the Virtual Network doesn't exist, Azure will create it based on the configuration provided:

```xml
<NetworkConfiguration>
  <VirtualNetworkSite name="NewVNetName" />
  <AddressAssignments>
     <InstanceAddress roleName="AVPWorkerRole">
      <Subnets>
        <Subnet name="NewSubnetName" />
      </Subnets>
    </InstanceAddress>
  </AddressAssignments>
</NetworkConfiguration>
```
* Replace "NewVNetName" with the name of the Virtual Network you want Azure to create, and "NewSubnetName" with the name of the subnet within that Virtual Network.

### Note on Domain Name and Public IP

```xml
<PublicIPs>
      <PublicIP name="MyPublicIP" domainNameLabel="myservice" />
</PublicIPs>
```
* PublicIP name: "MyPublicIP" – Provide a unique name for the public IP.
* domainNameLabel: "myservice" – Set this to your service's domain label.

Azure Extended Services Configuration:
* **Public IP**: You must provide a Public IP name in your configuration when creating the service.
* **Domain Name**: The domain name (domainNameLabel) is optional during initial creation and can be specified or updated later.

Match Public IP Name:
* Ensure that the `name` attribute under `<PublicIP>` ("MyPublicIP" in this example) matches the name used in your application code to fetch the public IP address dynamically.
* To ensure that the `domainNameLabel` matches between your configuration (.cscfg file) and the Azure portal settings.
   
#### Step 4: Deploy

1. Create Your Cloud Service (Extended Support):
   * Use the Azure portal to create a Cloud Service (Extended Support). Follow this guide: [Create Cloud Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services-extended-support/deploy-portal).
   *  Obtain Your Public IP DNS name:
        After the service is created, obtain the "Public IP DNS name" from the Azure portal. This URL will serve as your DNS name and Common Name (CN) for further configurations (e.g. bot.contoso.com).
        ![Public IP DNS name](Images/PublicIPDNSName.png).

2. Update the App Configurations:
   * Set up cloud service configuration with PowerShell:
     1. Open PowerShell, go to the folder that contains the file `configure_cloud.ps1`. The file is in the `Samples` directory.
     2. Run the PowerShell script with parameters:
       ```powershell
        .\configure_cloud.ps1 -p {path to project} -dns {your DNS name} -cn {your CN name, should be the same as your DNS name} -bid {your bot name} -aid {your bot app id} -as {your bot secret}
       ```
     For example:
     ```powershell
     .\configure_cloud.ps1 -p .\V1.0Samples\LocalMediaSamples\AudioVideoPlaybackBot\ -dns bot.contoso.com -cn bot.contoso.com -bid bot -aid 3853f935-2c6f-43d7-859d-6e8f83b519ae -as 123456!@#$%^
     ```

3. Deploy to Cloud Service (Extended Support):
   1. Configure Storage Account for Configuration Files.
   * To store configuration files for your Azure extended service, you'll need to set up a storage account. Follow these steps to configure the storage account:(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal).
   2.  Package Your Cloud Service for Deployment
   * Before you can create your Azure extended service, you need to package your cloud service application to include configuration files and dependencies.
   * Right click AudioVideoPlaybackBot, then click `Package...`.

**Option 1**: Upload to Azure Storage Account:
* Upload your packaged application (cspkg file) along with the .cscfg and .csdef files to an Azure Storage Account container.
* This method allows you to deploy directly from the Azure Storage Account during service creation.

**Option 2**: Use Local Files:
* Deploy directly from local files during the service creation process.
* Ensure all required files, including .cscfg and .csdef, are accessible and correctly referenced during deployment.

### Firewall setup

   * Please follow below steps to configure firewall.
     - [document](FirewallREADME.md)

### Local Deployment

In this section we explain how to configure a local PC (Windows 10) and then run AudioVideoPlaybackBot directly from the local environment.
AudioVideoPlaybackBot uses HTTP to listen and respond to HTTP REST API requests, but for incoming calls and online meeting communication this bot uses the lower-level TCP. We will be using `Ngrok` which supports TCP tunnels in addition to HTTP tunnels.
Below you'll learn how to configure ngrok in order to create a tunnel between your local computer and the internet.

### Configure NGROK

1. Go to [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up for a free account or log into your existing account. Once you've logged in, go to the dashboard and get your authtoken.

    >Note: A free Ngrok account, while it is good for a quick demos and once-in-while use of the media bots, for a more stable no-code change experience we recommend to purchase a Ngrok Pro account, which allows to use reserved domains and TCP addresses. Later you will see how these two settings can come handy having them fixed, pre-reserved in your Ngrok account.

2. If you have purchased a Ngrok Pro account (see the Note above), then make sure you have at least one reserved domain (e.g. `contoso.ngrok.io`), and at least one reserved TCP address (e.g. `1.tcp.ngrok.io:12332`). Write them down in your notes.
Alternatively, if you're using a free Ngrok account, you'd be required to write down the Ngrok domain and TCP address from the Ngrok console each time you restart Ngrok command on your PC.

3. Create an ngrok configuration file `ngrok.yml` (see [here](https://ngrok.com/docs#config) for more information on where this file can be located) and add this line on top of the file:

```json
authtoken: <Your-AuthToken>
```

4.As with the bot's messaging API, in order for the Real-time Media Platform to talk to your bot, your bot must be reachable over the internet. Ngrok makes this simple — add the following lines to your ngrok.yml:

Ngrok Free Version:

```json
tunnels:
  signaling:
    addr: "https://localhost:9441"
    proto: http
    host-header: localhost
```

Ngrok Pro Version:

```json
tunnels:
  signaling:
    addr: "https://localhost:9441"
    proto: http
    subdomain: <Your-Ngrok-Domain>
    host-header: localhost
```

5.Now, setup a TCP tunnel to forward the traffic to localhost. Write the following lines into your ngrok.yml:

Ngrok Free Account

```json
  media:
    addr: 8445
    proto: tcp
```

Ngrok Pro Account

```json
  media:
    addr: 8445
    proto: tcp
    remote_addr: <Your-Ngrok-TCP-Address>
```

6.Your ngrok.yml now should look something like this:

Ngrok Free Version

```json
authtoken: 43ksdfjlsielsdf_siwoeirwXXXX
tunnels:
  signaling:
    addr: "https://localhost:9441"
    proto: http
    host-header: localhost
  media:
    addr: 8445
    proto: tcp
```

Ngrok Pro Version

```json
authtoken: 43ksdfjlsielsdf_siwoeirwXXXX
tunnels:
  signaling:
    addr: "https://localhost:9441"
    proto: http
    subdomain: contoso
    host-header: localhost
  media:
    addr: 8445
    proto: tcp
    remote_addr: "1.tcp.ngrok.io:12332"
```

7.Now that the ngrok configuration is ready, launch it:

`ngrok.exe start -all -config <Path to your ngrok.yml>`

This starts ngrok and defines the public URLs which provide the tunnels to your localhost. The output looks like the following:

Ngrok Free Account

```cmd
Forwarding  tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:15448 -> localhost:8445
Forwarding  http://32f6055e17b3.ngrok.io -> https://localhost:9441
Forwarding  https://32f6055e17b3.ngrok.io -> https://localhost:9441
```

Here, 9441 is the signaling port, 8445 is the application-hosted port, 32f6055e17b3 is a randomly generated ngrok domain name (note that it will change every time you restart ngrok), 0.tcp.ngrok.io:15448 is a randomly generated remote TCP address (note that it will change every time you restart ngrok).

Ngrok Pro Account

```cmd
Forwarding  tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12332 -> localhost:8445
Forwarding  http://contoso.ngrok.io -> localhost:9441
Forwarding  https://contoso.ngrok.io -> localhost:9441
```

Here, 9441 is the signaling port, 8445 is the application-hosted port, and 12332 is the remote media port exposed by ngrok. Of course, these port numbers are just examples and you can use any available port.

#### Setting up domain and SSL certificates

>Note: This section is only required for application-hosted media bots and can be skipped if you don't host media yourself.

Application-hosted media uses certificates and TCP tunnels. The following steps are required:

1. Create and register a domain name with one of the popular domain registrars. For our example here, we'll refer to it as: `contoso.com`

2. A SSL certificate is required for your domain's based URLs. To make it easy, use a SSL certificate issued to a wildcard domain. In this case, it would be `*.contoso.com`. This SSL certificate is validated by the media SDK, so it should match your bot's public URL.

3. After installing the SSL certificate in your PC's local machine certificates store, open the certificate's details and take a note of the thumbprint as you will use it later.
![Thumbprint](Images/Thumbprint.png)

>Note: Thumbprint is a property that is  attached to the certificate object by CryptoAPI subsystem and this value is always hashed with SHA1 (160 bit) algorithm. Its value is typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long and should never include any whitespaces, colons or uppercases letters.

#### Configuring DNS Zone

Ngrok's public TCP endpoints have fixed URLs. They are 0.tcp.ngrok.io, 1.tcp.ngrok.io, and so on. You should have a DNS CNAME entry for your service that points to these URLs. In this example, let's say 0.contoso.com refers to 0.tcp.ngrok.io, 1.contoso.com refers to 1.tcp.ngrok.io, and so on.
You have two options to add CNAME records to your domain:

1. Go to your domain registrar website and follow their instructions to create and add CNAME records in the DNS for your domain.
2. Create and configure DNS Zone in Azure.

Here, we will show how to achieve the latter, following these steps:

1. Go to and log into your Azure subscription account at portal.azure.com

2. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-getstarted-portal) to create amd configure Azure DNS.

3. Note the Name servers for your Azure DNS Zone, which you can find at the top right corner of your Azure DNS zone dashboard:
![Nameservers](Images/Nameservers.png)

4. Go to your domain registrar, and change/add the default Name servers with the Name servers you've copied from your Azure DNS Zone dashboard.
    >Note: It may take up to 48 hours depending on your registrar policy to replicate the Name servers change.

5. Now, continue editing your Azure DNS zone settings by adding 10 new CNAME records. Click on `+ Record set` menu button to open a window for adding a new record set.

6. In the `Name` text field, enter `0`, so it constructs the full 0.contoso.com record.

7. In the `Type` dropbox choose `CNAME` as the record type.

8. In the `Alias` text field enter `0.tcp.ngrok.io.`. Then click `OK` button to save a new CNAME record.

9. Repeat steps 5-8 nine more times to create the CNAME records for 0-9.tcp.ngrok.io addresses.

10. At the end, you should have 10 new record sets look like this:
![CNAME](Images/CNAME.png)

#### Configure local environment

After you have configured your domain, ngrok and install SSL certificate on your PC, it's time to configure local environment and re-build the solution. Follow these steps:

1. Substitute the template values in [cert_setup.cmd](../cert_setup.cmd):
`%YOUR-SSL-CERTIFICATE-THUMBPRINT%` with your SSL Certificate Thumbprint, and
`%GUID from AssemblyInfo.cs of your project%` with the corresponding GUID obtained from `AssemblyInfo.cs`.

2. Open PowerShell or Command Console Window in Administrative mode.

3. Execute `cert_setup.cmd` from the command line.

4. Go to the root folder of your solution's file structure and find the PowerShell script [configure_cloud.ps1](../../../configure_cloud.ps1). Open the PowerShell console and execute this line:

```PowerShell
.\configure_cloud.ps1 -p .\V1.0Samples\LocalMediaSamples\AudioVideoPlaybackBot\ -dns 1.contoso.com -cn contoso.ngrok.io -thumb <YOUR CERTIFICATE THUMBPRINT> -bid <YOUR BOT NAME> -aid <YOUR BOT APP ID> -as <YOUR BOT APP SECRET> -sp 9441 -mp 8445 -tcp 12332
```

where:
* 1.contoso.com: is constructed from the following two parts:
  * 1: the subdomain number you find in the ngrok TCP Forwarding URL. E.g. tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12332
  * contoso.com: is your domain name for which you've created the CNAME record in your Azure DNS zone that redirects to (0-9).tcp.ngrok.io addresses
* contoso.ngrok.io: is the combination of your domain name and ngrok.io. For ngrok free accounts, this will be represented with a randomly generated subdomain name, which will change every time you restart ngrok.exe
* 9441: is the signaling port
* 8445: is the application-hosted port
* 12332: is the remote media port exposed by ngrok

5.Rebuild Visual Studio solution

#### Run AudioVideoPlaybackBot locally

Now, that you have configured all local environment settings and your Visual Studio solution is rebuilt, your bot can now run locally and all the flows work from your localhost.

Once ngrok is up and running, start your solution from Visual Studio, which loads it in the Azure Cloud Service emulator. Note any exception messages in the Output window. If the Media Platform instantiates successfully, you're ready to move to the next step. Testing.

##### Automated VMSS deployment with Github Worflows

###### Deployment Script Pre-Reqs

* [PowerShell 7.0+](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-70)
* [Azure Az PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
  * Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
  * This is not a hard requirement, but will automate the step to save the secret in your repo.
* Must be an owner of the Azure subscription where you are deploying the infrastructure.
* Must have permissions to create an Azure AD Application.
* Note: The Azure Bot must be created in a tenant where you are an adminstrator because the bot permissions require admin consent. The bot infrastructure does not need to be in the same tenant where the Azure bot was created. This is useful if you are not an administrator in your tenant and you can use a separate tenant for the Azure Bot and Teams calling.

| Secret Name          | Message |
| -------------------- |:-------------|
| localadmin           | 'localadmin' is the username for the admin on the provisioned VMSS VMs. The password entered is the password to login and will be configured for all VMs. |
| AadAppId             | This is the Azure AD Application Client Id that was created when creating an Azure Bot. Refer to the [registration instructions](https://microsoftgraph.github.io/microsoft-graph-comms-samples/docs/articles/calls/register-calling-bot.html) |
| AadAppSecret         | Client Secret created for the Azure AD Application during the Azure Bot registration. |
| ServiceDNSName       | Your public domain that will be used to join the bot to a call (ie bot.example.com) |

###### Installation

1. Set up SSL certificate and upload to the cloud service
    1. Create a wildcard certificate for your service. This certificate should not be a self-signed certificate. For instance, if your bot is hosted at `bot.contoso.com`, create the certificate for `*.contoso.com`.
    2. Copy the path to the PFX certificate
        1. Install [OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) to convert the certifcate from PEM to PFX
1. Navigate to the root directory of the sample in PowerShell.
1. Run `Get-AzContext` to ensure you are deploying to the correct subscription.
    1. You need to have the owner role on the subscription
    2. You need permissions to create a Service Principal
1. Run .\deploy.ps1 -OrgName <Your 2 - 7 Character Length Letter Abbreviation>
    *. - ie .\deploy.ps1 -OrgName TEB -Location eastus2

```powershell
    # Option 1 Run setup to deploy
    . .\deploy.ps1 -orgName <yourOrgName> -Location centralus
    # Option 1 Example
    . .\deploy.ps1 -orgName DNA -Location centralus
    
    # Option 2 Re-execute setup
    . .\deploy.ps1 -orgName <yourOrgName> -Location centralus -RunSetup
    # Option 2 Example
    . .\deploy.ps1 -orgName DNA -Location centralus -RunSetup
    
    # Option 3a Deploy from the commandline
    . .\deploy.ps1 -orgName <yourOrgName> -Location centralus -RunDeployment
    # Option 3a Example
    . .\deploy.ps1 -orgName DNA -Location centralus -RunDeployment

    # Option 3b Automated GitHub workflow
    The deployment will exectute via GitHub workflow
    - You can also manually run the 'BUILD' workflow to build the code
    - You can also manually run the 'INFRA' workflow after the previous workflow to deploy the infrastructure
```

###### Script Internals

The deployment script uses ADF (Azure Deployment Framework) under the path AudioVideoPlaybackBot\ADF. This folder has template and boilerplate code files that are used to define the github workflow actions and define the infrastructure resources required to deploy the bot and install it using DSC extensions.

1. Create a resource group with the naming convention ACU1-TEB-BOT-RG-D1 (Region Abbreviation - Your Org Name - BOT - Resource Group - Environment)
2. Create a storage account
    * Grant current user the 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' role
    * Grant the service principal the 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' role
3. Create a Key Vault
    * And grant current user the 'Key Vault Administrator' role
4. Create an Azure AD Application
    * The Application will be granted the 'Owner' role to the subscription.
5. Crete a GitHub Secret wiht name AZURE_CREDENTIALS_<YOURORGNAME>_BOT

    ```json
    {
        "clientId": "<GitHub Service Principal Client Id>",
        "clientSecret": "<GitHub Service Principal Secret>",
        "tenantId": "<Tenant ID>",
        "subscriptionId": "<Subscription ID>",
        "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
        "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
        "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
        "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
        "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
        "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
    }
    ```

5. Generate the deployment parameters file, build workflow and infrastructure workflow
6. Upload the PFX certificate to Key Vault
7. Add the secrets and environment variables to Key Vault

After the script runs successfully, you should see the following:

1. New resource group with the following resources:
    * Storage Account
    * Key Vault
2. Azure AD Application in Azure AD
3. In your GitHub Repo, Navigate to Settings > Secrets. You should see a new secret named 'AZURE_CREDENTIALS_<YOURORGNAME>_BOT'
4. Three new files have been created. Check these files in and push them to your repo.
    * app-build-<YourOrgName>.yml
    * app-infra-release-<YourOrgName>.yml
    * azuredeploy<YourOrgName>.parameters.json
5. Once these files have been pushed to your repo, they will kick of the infrastructure and code deployment workflows.

###### Infrastructure Deployment

The GitHub Action app-infra-release-<YourOrgName>.yml deploys the infrastructure.

You can also run the infrastructure deployment locally using the -RunDeployment flag.

```
.\deploy.ps1 -OrgName TEB -RunDeployment
```

###### Update DNS

Your DNS Name for your bot needs to point to the public load balacer in order to call your bot and have it join a meeting.

1. Find the public IP resource for the load balancer and copy the DNS name.
2. Navigate to your DNS settings for your domain and create a new CNAME record.
    ie CNAME bot acu1-teb-bot-d1-lbplb01-1.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com

###### Deploy the Solution

The GitHub Action app-build-<YourOrgName>.yml builds the solution and uploads the output to the storage account.
Once the infrastructure is deployed, DSC will pull the code from the storage account.

### Test

>Note: The Teams meeting should be scheduled in the same Teams tenant as the one was used to grant the AVPlaybackBot bot access permissions.

1. Schedule a Teams meeting with another person.

    ![Test Meeting1](Images/TestMeeting1.png)

2. Copy the Join Microsoft Teams Meeting link. Depending on where you copy this, this may be encoded as a safe link in Outlook.

    ![Test Meeting2](Images/TestMeeting2.png)

    Example, `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19:cd9ce3da56624fe69c9d7cd026f9126d@thread.skype/1509579179399?context={"Tid":"72f988bf-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx","Oid":"550fae72-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx","MessageId":"1536978844957"}`

4. Invite your Bot to join the meeting by interacting with it thru the Postman HTTP REST API service calls, _adjusting the service URL appropriately_.
    1. Use Postman to post the following `JSON` payload.

##### Request

        ```http
        POST https://bot.contoso.com/joinCall
        Content-Type: application/json
        {
            "JoinURL": "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/...",
        }
        ```

##### Response

        The guid "491f0500-401f-4f11-8af4-2eff4c0a0643" in the response will be your call id. Use your call id for the next request.

        ```json
        {
            "legId": "491f0500-401f-4f11-8af4-2eff4c0a0643",
