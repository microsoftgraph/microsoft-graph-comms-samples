# Getting Started (Local Run Version)
1.	Installation process
  * Install Visual Studio 2017
  * Launch CommsSamples.sln in <Repository>\Samples with Visual Studio 2017 (VS2017)
  * Click menu Build/"Build Solution" to build the whole solution
  * Setup ngrok.
    - Sign up for a free ngrok account. Once signed up, go to the ngrok [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and get your auth token.
    - Create an ngrok configuration file `ngrok.yml` as follows:
        ```yaml
        authtoken: %replace_with_auth_token_from_dashboard%
        tunnels:
          signaling:
            addr: 9442
            proto: http
          media: 
            addr: 8445
            proto: tcp
        ```
    - Start ngrok: `ngrok http https://localhost:44379 -host-header=localhost`. You will see an output like this:
        ```ymal
        Session Status                online
        Account                       YourName (Plan: Free)
        Version                       x.x.xx

        Forwarding                    http://e6c2321a.ngrok.io -> https://localhost:44379
        Forwarding                    https://e6c2321a.ngrok.io -> https://localhost:44379
        ```
    - From **your** output, in line Forwarding (yours will be different) the first url`https://e6c2321a.ngrok.io` will be your bot base uri. Write down the bot base uri as **\{BotBaseUrl}** for next steps.
  * Update the following elements in appsettings.json file in project NotificationBot.
    - Bot/AppId: "**\{ApplicationId}**"
    - Bot/AppSecret: "**\{ApplicationSecret}**"
