# Introduction
The sample demostrates calling a group of users. 

# Sample status
    1. A team of engineers use the Group Call Bot to call all of them at once, if any issue needing their attention occurs.
    2. An incident occurs and the Group Call Bot creates a group call to all the members of the team.
    3. The Group Call Bot uses the participants update notification to keep track of the participants of the call.
    4. The incident is handled and the call ends.
    
# Note
    For a call created by the Group Call Bot, some regular Team's features are not enabled for the users, such as call ended and started notifications on a shared group chat, call history (may not be updated correctly), Companion Mode, transferring between a user's devices, recording, transcription and dialout to PSTN numbers from the group call.

# Getting Started (Local Run Version)
    1. Installation process
        * Install Visual Studio 2017
        * Launch GroupCallBot.sln in <Repository>\Samples\V1.0Samples\StatelessSamples with Visual Studio 2017 (VS2017)
        * Click menu Build/"Build Solution" to build the whole solution
        * Setup ngrok.
            - Sign up for a free ngrok account. Once signed up, go to the ngrok [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and get your auth token.
            - Create an ngrok configuration file `ngrok.yml` as follows:
                ```yaml
                authtoken: %replace_with_auth_token_from_dashboard%
                tunnels:
                  signaling:
                    addr: 9442
                    proto: http
                  media: 
                    addr: 8445
                    proto: tcp
                ```
            - Start ngrok: `ngrok http https://localhost:44379 -host-header=localhost`. You will see an output like this:
                ```ymal
                Session Status                online
                Account                       YourName (Plan: Free)
                Version                       x.x.xx
                Region                        United States (us)
                Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
                Forwarding                    http://e6c2321a.ngrok.io -> https://localhost:44379
                Forwarding                    https://e6c2321a.ngrok.io -> https://localhost:44379
                ```
            - From **your** output, in line Forwarding (yours will be different) the first url`https://e6c2321a.ngrok.io` will be your bot base uri. Write down the bot base uri as **\{BotBaseUrl}** for next steps.
        * Update the following elements in appsettings.json file in project GroupCallBot.
            - Bot/AppId: "**\{ApplicationId}**"
            - Bot/AppSecret: "**\{ApplicationSecret}**"
            - Bot/BotBaseUrl: "**\{BotBaseUrl}**"

# Build and Test
    1. Get the users' object IDs as \{UserObjectId-1} for user1, \{UserObjectId-2} for user2 and \{UserObjectId-3} for user3, to all the group call needs to be made. 

    2. Login to Teams client with all the list of users, for the scenario in order to get call from the Bot.

    3. Open "Postman", create a Post request --> {BotBaseUrl}/participantscalling/raise and then add objectIds and tenantId in Body (like mentioned below). Click on Send.
        {  
            "objectIds": [
                "{UserObjectId-1}",
                "{UserObjectId-2}",
                "{UserObjectId-3}"
            ],
            "tenantId": "{TenantId}"
        }

    4. Bot will call all the users.

    5. Logs will have the list of participants, updated as and when user will accept the group call.
