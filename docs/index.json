Refer to Registering a Calling Bot on how to register the callback URL. This callback is used for all incoming calls to the application. Protocol determination The incoming notification is provided in legacy format for compatibility with the previous protocol . In order to convert the call to the Microsoft Graph protocol, the bot must determine the notification is in legacy format and reply with: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content The application will again receive the notification but this time it will be in the Microsoft Graph protocol. You may configure the protocol your application supports and avoid receiving the initial callback in legacy format. The setting is available as a configuration option in the Skype Channel. Redirects for region affinity We will invoke your callback from the data-center hosting the call. The call may start in any data-center and does not take into account region affinities. The notification will be sent to your deployment depending on the GeoDNS resolution. If your application determines, by inspecting the initial notification payload or otherwise, that it needs to run in a different deployment, the application may reply with: HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: your-new-location You may decide to pickup the call and answer . You can specify the callback URL to handle this particular call. This is useful for stateful instances where your call is handled by a particular partition and you want to embed this information on the callback URL for routing to the right instance. Authenticating the callback Application should inspect the token passed by on the notification to validate the request. Whenever the API raises a web hook event, the API gets an OAUTH token from us, with audience as the application's App ID and adds it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. The application is expected to validate this token before accepting the callback request.

    "title": "Supporting Multiple Applications Within Single Code Base",
    "keywords": "Supporting Multiple Applications Within Single Code Base Some developers may wish to support multiple applications from within the same application code. With very little effort, this can be done using multiple instances of ICommunicationsClient . There are some steps that should be taken to ensure that we make outbound requests with the right application, and we forward incoming notifications to the right application. This writeup will demonstrate how to alter the existing samples to add multiple application support. We have not created a sample of this scenario explicitly given that it is not a standard way to use the Graph SDK. Create multiple communications clients First, each application instance requires it's own ICommunicationsClient instance, given that it supports a single IRequestAuthenticationProvider Let's change the Bot ICommunicationsClient Client to an IDictionary<string, ICommunicationsClient> Clients and create our clients. /// <summary> /// Prevents a default instance of the <see cref=\"Bot\"/> class from being created. /// </summary> private Bot() { this.AddClient( Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftAppId, Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftAppPassword); this.AddClient( Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftApp2Id, Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftApp2Password); } private void AddClient(string appId, string appSecret) { // Create a unique notification uri for first app instance // This appends the app id to the callback uri so we get // https://base.uri/callbacks/{appId} var notificationUri = new Uri( Service.Instance.Configuration.CallControlBaseUrl, appId); var builder = new CommunicationsClientBuilder(\"AudioVideoPlaybackBot\", appId); builder .SetAuthenticationProvider( new AuthenticationProvider( appId, appSecret, Service.Instance.Configuration.TokenAudienceResourceLink)) .SetNotificationUrl(notificationUri) .SetMediaPlatformSettings(Service.Instance.Configuration.MediaPlatformSettings) .SetServiceBaseUrl(Service.Instance.Configuration.PlaceCallEndpointUrl); var client = builder.Build(); this.Clients.Add(appId, client); client.Calls().OnIncoming += this.CallsOnIncoming; client.Calls().OnUpdated += this.CallsOnUpdated; } /// <summary> /// Gets the contained app clients /// </summary> public IDictionary<string, ICommunicationsClient> Clients { get; } Let's also add a reference to the ICallCollection to the call handler for ease of access. This will allow us to reference the correct collection/client from any given call id. /// <summary> /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=\"CallHandler\"/> class. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"callCollection\">The call collection.</param> /// <param name=\"call\">The call.</param> public CallHandler(ICallCollection callCollection, ICall call); /// <summary> /// Gets the call collection /// </summary> public ICallCollection CallCollection { get; } /// <summary> /// Gets the call /// </summary> public ICall Call { get; } Handle notifications Next we need to adjust the incoming call controller to forward the notifications to the right client. If there is no need to handle incoming call, then the above configuration will automatically route the the correct apps endpoint. If we need to handle incoming call, we can either have a default app process all those scenarios, or the callback URI of each app can contain the app id. For example, if our service URI is https://base.uri/callback , we can set all our bots to use this URI directly, but then we lose knowledge of which app is receiving the incoming call. If we change each app's callback URI to https://base.uri/callback/{appId} (example: https://base.uri/callback/9ecd52e5-6592-42b7-b562-093f37f13bde , where the appId is 9ecd52e5-6592-42b7-b562-093f37f13bde) then we have the app context when an incoming call occurs. Of course there are other ways to get the app ID, like from the auth token or the payload, but this is one simple option. To handle the app id in the URI the controllers for callbacks need to be changed to the following: /// <summary> /// Gets a reference to singleton sample bot/client instance /// </summary> private IDictionary<string, ICommunicationsClient> Clients => Bot.Instance.Clients; /// <summary> /// Handle a callback for an incoming call. /// Here we don't know what application is receiving the callback. /// </summary> /// <returns> /// The <see cref=\"HttpResponseMessage\"/>. /// </returns> [HttpPost] [Route(\"\")] public Task<HttpResponseMessage> OnIncomingRequestAsync() { // Pick some app id to handle this call. var appId = this.Clients.Keys.First(); return this.OnIncomingRequestAsync(appId); } /// <summary> /// Handle a callback for an incoming call or notification. /// Here we've added the application id to the callback URI. /// </summary> /// <returns> /// The <see cref=\"HttpResponseMessage\"/>. /// </returns> [HttpPost] [Route(\"{appId}\")] public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> OnIncomingRequestAsync(string appId) { Log.Info(new CallerInfo(), LogContext.FrontEnd, $\"Received HTTP {this.Request.Method}, {this.Request.RequestUri}\"); // Pass the incoming message to the sdk. The sdk takes care of what to do with it. var client = this.Clients[appId]; var response = await client.ProcessNotificationAsync(this.Request).ConfigureAwait(false); // Enforce the connection close to ensure that requests are evenly load balanced so // calls do no stick to one instance of the worker role. response.Headers.ConnectionClose = true; return response; } Additional notes There are a few items not addressed here. For instance, when a VTC joins a meeting, which app should it use? This has been purposefuly excluded from this guide given that it is unique business logic. Some may want a different bot configuration for each client, others may associate unique permissions to each bot and use depending on action being performed."

In this topic you will learn how to register a new Calling Bot. Register your bot in the Azure Bot Service Complete the following steps: Register a bot through Azure Bot Channel Registration . Once you complete the registration, take a note of the registered config values (Bot Name, Application Id, and Application Secret). You will need these values later in the code samples. Enable the Microsoft Teams channel and enable calling on the Calling tab. Fill in the Webhook (for calling) where you will receive incoming notifications. E.g. https://{your domain}/api/calls . Refer to Connect a bot to channels for more information on how to configure channels. Permissions Add Microsoft Graph permissions for calling to your bot Microsoft Graph exposes granular permissions controlling the access apps have to resources. As a developer, you decide which permissions for Microsoft Graph your app requests. The Microsoft Graph Calling APIs support Application permissions, which are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or bots. Application permissions can only be consented by a tenant administrator. Calling bots and applications have some capabilties that will need tenant administrator consent. Below is a list of those permissions: Permission Display String Description Admin Consent Required Calls.Initiate.All Initiate outgoing 1:1 calls from the app (preview) Allows the app to place outbound calls to a single user and transfer calls to users in your organization's directory, without a signed-in user. Yes Calls.InitiateGroupCall.All Initiate outgoing group calls from the app (preview) Allows the app to place outbound calls to multiple users and add participants to meetings in your organization, without a signed-in user. Yes Calls.JoinGroupCall.All Join Group Calls and Meetings as an app (preview) Allows the app to join group calls and scheduled meetings in your organization, without a signed-in user. The app will be joined with the privileges of a directory user to meetings in your tenant. Yes Calls.JoinGroupCallasGuest.All Join Group Calls and Meetings as a guest (preview) Allows the app to anonymously join group calls and scheduled meetings in your organization, without a signed-in user. The app will be joined as a guest to meetings in your tenant. Yes Calls.AccessMedia.All *see below* Access media streams in a call as an app (preview) Allows the app to get direct access to participant media streams in a call, without a signed-in user. Yes Important: You may not use the Microsoft.Graph.Calls.Media API to record or otherwise persist media content from calls or meetings that your bot accesses. Assigning permissions You pre-configure the application permissions your app needs when you register your app. To add permissions from the Azure Bot Registration Portal: From the Settings blade, click Manage . This is the link appearing by the Microsoft App ID . This link will open a window where you can scroll down to add Microsoft Graph Permissions: under Microsoft Graph , choose Add next to Application Permissions and then select the permissions your app requires in the Select Permissions dialog. You can also add permissions by accessing your app through the Microsoft App Registration Portal . Getting administrator consent An administrator can either consent to these permissions using the Azure portal when your app is installed in their organization, or you can provide a sign-up experience in your app through which administrators can consent to the permissions you configured. Once administrator consent is recorded by Azure AD, your app can request tokens without having to request consent again. You can rely on an administrator to grant the permissions your app needs at the Azure portal , but often a better option is to provide a sign-up experience for administrators by using the Azure AD v2.0 /adminconsent endpoint. Please refer to the instructions on constructing an Admin Consent URL for more detail. Note : Constructing the Tenant Admin Consent URL requires a configured Redirect URI/Reply URL in the App Registration Portal . To add reply URLs for your bot, access your bot registration, choose Advanced Options > Edit Application Manifest. Add your Redirect URI to the field replyURLs. Important : Any time you make a change to the configured permissions, you must also repeat the Admin Consent process. Changes made in the app registration portal will not be reflected until consent has been reapplied by the tenant's administrator. Register bot in Microsoft Teams The code samples can be used in combination with a Microsoft Teams App Manifest settings to add the Calling and Video buttons for a 1:1 bot interaction. To develop calling bot, add 'supportsCalling' and 'supportsVideo' boolean properties to the bots section in the app manifest and the bot is all set to receive calls once installed (either to a personal context or a team). App Manifests can be uploaded through the App Studio in the Microsoft Teams client. { \"$schema\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/preview/DevPreview/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json\", \"manifestVersion\": \"1.3\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"id\": \"%MICROSOFT-APP-ID%\", \"packageName\": \"com.example.myapp\", \"developer\": { \"name\": \"Publisher Name\", \"websiteUrl\": \"https://website.com/\", \"privacyUrl\": \"https://website.com/privacy\", \"termsOfUseUrl\": \"https://website.com/app-tos\" }, \"name\": { \"short\": \"Name of your app (<=30 chars)\", \"full\": \"Full name of app, if longer than 30 characters\" }, \"description\": { \"short\": \"Short description of your app\", \"full\": \"Full description of your app\" }, \"icons\": { \"outline\": \"%FILENAME-32x32px%\", \"color\": \"%FILENAME-192x192px\" }, \"accentColor\": \"%HEX-COLOR%\", \"bots\": [ { \"botId\": \"%MICROSOFT-APP-ID-REGISTERED-WITH-BOT-FRAMEWORK%\", \"needsChannelSelector\": false, \"isNotificationOnly\": false, \"scopes\": [ \"team\", \"personal\", \"groupchat\" ], \"supportsCalling\": true, \"supportsVideo\": true } ] }"

    "title": "State Management",
    "keywords": "State Management All states of resources associated with a Call in the Graph Calling SDK are handled internally in the SDK itself. The notifications and events for a particular ICall or a particular resource contained in ICall are always received on a single application instance. This means that the instance should be maintaining the state of a call in memory and a single ICall object exists throughout the duration of the call. These are called Stateful calls and the bots are called Stateful bots. The notification or events for any call can hit any instance of the application. This means that everytime a notification comes to an instance, a new Call object is created by the Graph Calling Core SDK and is destroyed once the notification/event has been handled. Any state required for the call should be maintained by the bot logic. These type of bots are called Stateless bots signifying that the Graph Calling Core SDK itself does not maintain any state for the bot. Differences Between Stateless and Stateful Bots The major difference between Stateless and Stateful bots is that maintaining Stateful bots requires that the bot instance would not go down when a call is in progress. If the instance goes down, the call object is lost and no notifications or events are received by the Graph Calling SDK and the calls gets dropped by the server. On the contrast, in Stateless bots, even if the bot instance goes down, the events and notifications go to the other instances of the bot and the bot can continue its logic. Important In Application Hosted Media Calls , the media is handled by a single instance of the bot. Therefore, all the notifications should reach the same instance of the bot for signaling of the media to be properly handled. Thus stateless scenarios for Application Hosted Media bots are not supported."

    "keywords": "Graph Communications Bot Media SDK The Real-time Media Platform enables bots to interact with Microsoft Teams calls and meetings using real-time voice, video and screen sharing. This is an advanced capability which allows the bot to send and receive voice and video content frame by frame. The bot has \"raw\" access to the voice, video and screen sharing media streams. (Bots which process media themselves are called application-hosted media bots, as opposed to simpler service-hosted media bots that rely on the Real-time Media platform for all media processing.) For example, in a 1:1 call with a bot, as the user speaks, the bot will receive 50 audio frames per second, with each frame containing 20 milliseconds (ms) of audio. An application-hosted media bot can perform real-time speech recognition as the audio frames are received, rather than having to wait for a recording after the user has stopped speaking. The bot can also send and receive high-definition-resolution video, including video-based screen sharing content. The platform provides a simple \"socket\"-like API for the bot to send and receive media, and handles the real-time encoding and decoding of audio/video packets, using codecs such as SILK and G.722 for audio and H.264 for video. The platform also handles all media packet encryption/decryption and packet network transmission automatically, so the bot just needs to concern itself with the actual audio/video content. A real-time media bot may participate in 1:1 calls as well as meetings with multiple participants. Select a class on the left to dive into the reference docs"

    "title": "Testing of Bots",
    "keywords": "Testing of Bots This document describes how to setup the Graph Calling SDK to run on your localhost, run tests against it against the Graph Platform. Caution Do not use this testing setup for production traffic. Please limit it to debugging your bot locally with test traffic because of security concerns. Prerequisites The testing setup requires ngrok to create tunnels to localhost. Go to ngrok and sign up for a free account. Once you signed up, go to the dashboard and get your authtoken. Create an ngrok configuration file ngrok.yml with the following data authtoken: <Your-AuthToken> Tip Free ngrok account does not provide static tunnels. Tunnels change everytime a tunnel is created. So, if using free account, it is recommended to not close ngrok until it's use is completed. Tip Ngrok does not require sign up if you do not use TCP tunnels. Setting up Signaling In order for the platform to talk to your bot, the bot needs to be reached over the internet. So, an ngrok tunnel is created in http mode with an address pointing to a port on your localhost. Add the following lines to your ngrok config tunnels: signaling: addr: <Localhost Signaling Port> proto: http Setting up Application Hosted Media Note This section is only required for Application Hosted Media bots and can be skipped if you do not host media yourself. Application Hosted Media uses certificates and TCP tunnels to properly work. The following steps are required in order for proper media establishment. Ngrok's public TCP endpoints have fixed urls. They are 0.tcp.ngrok.io , 1.tcp.ngrok.io , etc. You should have a dns CNAME entry for your service that points to these urls. In this example, let's say 0.bot.contoso.com is pointing to 0.tcp.ngrok.io , and similarly for other urls. Now you require an SSL certificate for the url you own. To make it easy, use an SSL certificate issued to a wild card domain. In this case, it would be *.bot.contoso.com . This ssl certificate is validated by Media flow so should match your media flow's public url. Note down the thumbprint and install the certificate in your machine certificates. Now, we setup a TCP tunnel to forward the traffic to localhost. Write the following lines into your ngrok config. media: addr: <Localhost Media Port> proto: tcp Important Because ngrok's tcp urls can be same for multiple users (just differing in ports), it is possible for a third party to look like your service. This is a security issue. Therefore this document should be followed only for testing and also using a separate domain that is not linked to your production services. Start Ngok Now that ngrok configuration is ready, start it up. Download the ngrok executable and run the following command ngrok.exe start -all -config <Path to your ngrok.yml> This would start ngrok and provide you the public urls which provide the tunnels to your localhost. The output looks like the following Forwarding http://signal.ngrok.io -> localhost:12345 Forwarding https://signal.ngrok.io -> localhost:12345 Forwarding tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12332 -> localhost:8445 Here, 12345 is my signaling port, 8445 is the local media port and 12332 is the remote media port exposed by ngrok. Note that we have a forwarding from 1.bot.contoso.com to 1.tcp.ngrok.io . This will be used as the media url for bot. Update Code Once ngrok is up and running, we update the code to use the config we just setup. Update Signaling In the builder, change the NotficationUrl to the signaling url provided by ngrok. clientBuilder.SetNotificationUrl( new Uri(\"https://signal.ngrok.io/notificationEndpoint\")) Important Replace signal with the one provided by ngrok and the NotificationEndpoint with the controller path that receives notification. Important The url in SetNotificationUrl must be HTTPS. Important Your local instance must be listening to http traffic on the signaling port. The requests made by Graph Platform will reach the bot as localhost http traffic when End to End encryption is not setup. Update Media Update your MediaPlatformSettings to the following. var mediaPlatform = new MediaPlatformSettings { ApplicationId = <Your application id> MediaPlatformInstanceSettings = new MediaPlatformInstanceSettings { CertificateThumbprint = <Your SSL Cert thumbprint>, InstanceInternalPort = <Localhost media port>, InstancePublicPort = <Ngrok exposed remote media port>, InstancePublicIPAddress = new IPAddress(0x0), ServiceFqdn = <Media url for bot (eg: 1.bot.contoso.com)>, }, } Caution The Certificate Thumbprint provided above should match the Service FQDN. That is why the DNS entries are required. Caveats The free accounts of ngrok do NOT provide End to End encryption. The HTTPS data ends at the ngrok url and the data flows unencrypted from ngrok to localhost. You require paid ngrok account and configuration update to use End to End encryption. See ngrok docs for steps on setting up secure E2E tunnels. Because the bot callback url is dynamic, incoming call scenarios won't work as they are part of bot registration and they are static. One way to fix this is to use a paid ngrok account which provides fixed subdomains to which you can point your bot and the platform."

    "title": "Graph Core and Communications SDK Concepts",
    "keywords": "Graph Core and Communications SDK Concepts The Graph signaling SDK is quite flexible and can run in multiple environments, and support both stateful and stateless architectures. It can run on Azure Cloud Service , Azure Service Fabric , and Azure App Service . Furthermore, because the SDK supports both .net framework 4.6.1+ and netstandard 2.0 it is cross platform . This article describes the key concepts in order to effectively utilize the Graph Core SDK and the Graph Communications SDK including the Calling SDK. Graph Core SDK The @Microsoft.Graph.DefaultContainerClient object is the entry point to the Graph Core SDK. The majority of the Graph Core SDK is automatically generated by the Graph SDK generator using the OData resource model. It reflects the REST-ful wire protocol provided by the Graph Communications service. Graph Communications SDK and Client Builder The ICommunicationsClient object is the entry point to the Graph Communications SDK and the Calling SDK. This SDK is designed for stateful services and provides additional support on top of the Graph Core SDK for resource state management and media management. The ICommunicationsClientBuilder is the object used to construct a new ICommunicationsClient with the desired settings. Building media bots has additional considerations which are further outlined in the media section . Notification Dispatching Notifications for root collections, such as the ICallCollection generated by ICommunicationsClient.Calls() , are handled in a single queue. Any root resource, such as the ICall , that has been added to the root collection is given it's own queue. Any child resources, of the root resource, such as the ICallParticipant use the same queue as the root resource. Each queue will delivered event callbacks to the developer sequentially. The SDK will wait to deliver the next event callbacks until all the callbacks for the current event have been processed. This has been done as to help developers avoid concurrency issues and will in the future support resource versioning and jitter buffers. Important It is important for all event handlers to be non-blocking, and any long running operations need to be offloaded to another thread. Long running operations in any event will block further operations from being raised for the given resource. Example Outgoing Calls To illustrate functionality of the Graph Calling SDK, the below examples demonstrate 2 common scenarios: how to make an outbound call to a Microsoft Teams user and how to join an existing Microsoft Teams meeting. Making an Outbound Call Assuming a bot has been properly registered and deployed, the ICommunicationsClient configured and built. The bot needs to create the Call object with the corresponding parameters and pass the object to the CallCollectionExtensions.AddAsync method as follows: var callResource = new Call { Subject = \"**Subject**\", Targets = new List<ParticipantInfo> { new InvitationParticipantInfo { Identity = new IdentitySet { User = new Identity { Id = \"**Target's AAD ObjectId GUID**\" }, }, } }, TenantId = \"**The id of the tenant that will host the meeting**\" }; var mediaSession = this.Client.CreateMediaSession(**media session settings**); var call = await this.Client.Calls().AddAsync(callResource, mediaSession); SDK will store the state of the call in memory after calling AddAsync . The returned call object above contains the call Id set by the service. Making an Outbound Call to Join an Existing Microsoft Teams Meeting The above example shows how to create an outbound call to single or multiple participants and create a new conversation. If the bot needs to join an existing conversation, the SDK provides an overload of AddAsync that takes JoinMeetingParameters as input. The bot needs to create the JoinMeetingParameters object with the corresponding meeting parameters and pass the object to the CallCollectionExtensions.AddAsync method as follows: var chatInfo = new ChatInfo { MessageId = \"**Message Id**\", ThreadId = \"**Thread Id**\", ReplyChainMessageId = \"**Reply Chain Message Id**\" }; var meetingInfo = new OrganizerMeetingInfo { Organizer = new IdentitySet { User = new Identity { Id = \"**Meeting Organizer's AAD ObjectId GUID**\" }, } }; meetingInfo.Organizer.User.SetTenantId(\"**TenantId Guid**\"); var mediaSession = this.Client.CreateMediaSession(**media session settings**); var joinCallParameters = new JoinMeetingParameters( chatInfo, meetingInfo, mediaSession); var call = await this.Client.Calls().AddAsync(joinCallParameters); SDK will store the state of the call in memory after calling AddAsync . The returned call object above contains the callId set by the service. Example Incoming Calls Any time another user or bot places a call to your bot, you will receive a notification to the global application endpoint specified when registering your bot. Incoming call scenarios are supported with both Service Hosted Media and App Hosted Media configurations. Important For all incoming call scenarios, the initial incoming call notification will still be received using the BotBuilder protocol. The Graph SDK automatically returns 204 No Content to the initial notification to invoke the new Graph protocol. Answering incoming call with application hosted media First, subscibe to incoming calls. this.Client.Calls().OnIncoming += this.CallsOnIncoming; When incoming call comes, the bot needs to answer with an IMediaSession . This can be a media session created using the ICommunicationsClient.CreateMediaSession() extension or a custom IMediaSession . private void CallsOnIncoming(ICallCollection sender, CollectionEventArgs<ICall> collectionEventArgs) { var mediaSession = this.Client.CreateMediaSession( new AudioSocketSettings { StreamDirections = StreamDirection.Recvonly, SupportedAudioFormat = AudioFormat.Pcm16K }, new VideoSocketSettings { StreamDirections = StreamDirection.Sendrecv, ReceiveColorFormat = VideoColorFormat.NV12, SupportedSendVideoFormats = new List<VideoFormat> { VideoFormat.NV12_720x1280_30Fps, VideoFormat.NV12_1280x720_30Fps } }); // Run async as not to block subsequent notifications. Task.Run(async () => { await collectionEventArgs .AddedResources .FirstOrDefault() .AnswerAsync(mediaSession) .ConfigureAwait(false); }); } Answer incoming call with service hosted media First subscibe to incoming calls. this.Client.Calls().OnIncoming += this.CallsOnIncoming; When incoming call comes, the bot will answer with a ServiceHostedMediaConfig . private void CallsOnIncoming(ICallCollection sender, CollectionEventArgs<ICall> collectionEventArgs) { // Run async as not to block subsequent notifications. Task.Run(async () => { await collectionEventArgs .AddedResources .FirstOrDefault() .AnswerAsync(new Modality[] { Modality.Audio }) .ConfigureAwait(false); }); } State Management Graph Communications SDK can be used to store state of all resources in memory. This has 2 implications: The instance hosting the call needs to be up throughout the lifetime of a call. Any subsequent asynchronous notifications delivered by the service need to be redirected to the instance hosting the call. Any bot that hosts its own media stack should to be built using the Graph Communications SDK given that the media stream has a requirement that it needs to persist in memory throughout the lifetime of the call. More details can be found in the State Management article."

The strengths and limitations of each are further explained in the State Management article. Media Session For calls with locally hosted media the ICallCollection has an extended AddAsync method which expects an IMediaSession object. This object contains the IAudioSocket and IVideoSocket composition. The IMediaSession also knows how to construct the MediaConfiguration required by the back end services to enable the AV stream to flow through the call instance. A Media Extension SDK has been added on top of this SDK to support locally hosted media scenarios. To use this extension the ICommunicationsClient must be built with MediaCommunicationsClientBuilderExtensions.SetMediaPlatformSettings .

Authentication Provider All calls made and received by the SDK must be authenticated by the bot developers. The SDK requires the developers to implement the IRequestAuthenticationProvider interface and specify it when building the ICommunicationsClient . There are two parts to the interface. AuthenticateOutboundRequestAsync : This method should add the Authorization header to the outbound HTTP requests from the SDK. AuthenticateOutboundRequestAsync : This method should validate the Authorization header for incoming HTTP requests from Graph, extract the Tenant ID from that header and provide it to the SDK. Examples of the Authentication Provider can be found in samples . Notification Handling The Graph Platform sends out notifications via HTTP that need to be handled by the Bot Developers. The Platform sends out notifications on the notification url, and the bot developers should listen to HTTP messages on that url. Once the HTTP message has been received by the developer, they need to forward the message to ICommunicationsClient using the ProcessNotificationAsync method. The SDK processes the notification, calls the IRequestAuthenticationProvider and raises any corresponding events asynchronously. The SDK then returns a HttpResponseMessage that needs to be sent out as a response to the Graph Platform. Note Developers using ASP.NET Core should convert the HttpRequest object into HttpRequestMessage before passing it to the SDK. Also, they need to convert the resulting HttpResponseMessage into HttpResponse . Select a class on the left to dive into the reference docs"

    "keywords": "Graph Calling SDK Introduction The Graph Calling SDK simplifies the creation of calling and meetings bots that use the Microsoft Graph Calling APIs . The SDK provides the functionality to manage states of resources in memory and simplify tasks like call setup and media session establishment. It provides interfaces for bot's service-to-service interactions with calls and meetings, including an optional Media Extension SDK that enables a bot developer to host media on their machines and gain access to low level Audio/Video sockets and media streams. SDK The Graph Calling SDK is built on top of the Microsoft Graph API and distributed as NuGet packages. The Core Concepts article is designed to better explain all the constructs used by the SDKs. To dive right in and deploy a Calling Bot refer to the documentation in each sample for further instructions. The SDK is divided into multiple nuget packages each described as below. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Common ( nuget ): This is the nuget containing all the utilities used throughout the Stateful SDK. It contains telemetry, http, obfuscation support along with helper methods. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Core ( nuget ): This library contains the serialization and notification for the communications APIs. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Core.Calls ( nuget ): This library contains the calling contracts and is a duplicate of Microsoft.Graph SDK but only with Communication APIs. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Client ( nuget ): This is the base client for the Stateful SDK. This implements all the common SDK features used within different verticals like calling, etc. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls ( nuget ): This is the SDK that implements calling APIs. This supports making, receiving, and joining calls with Microsoft Teams users, and creating voice and video enabled bots. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media ( nuget ): This library allows developers to use the Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls SDK and gain direct access to the audio, video, screen sharing, and data streams. This is an optional library on top of Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls Microsoft.Skype.Bots.Media ( nuget ): The Real-Time Media Platform for Bots adds a new dimension to how bots can interact with users: by enabling real-time voice, video and screen sharing modalities. Concepts and Examples For more details on concepts used by the SDK and examples on joining calls and receiving calls please refer to the concepts and examples page. You can find samples using the following service: Stateful bot using Application Hosted Media on Azure Cloud Service Stateful bot using Application Hosted Media on Azure Service Fabric Stateful bot using Service Hosted Media running on Azure App Service . ICommunicationsClient and Extension Methods The Stateful SDK is exposed using a single class ICommunicationsClient . This class is defined in the Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Client nuget and has no dependency on the Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls calling vertical nuget package. The different verticals therefore make heavy usage of extension methods on ICommunicationsClient rather than standalone functions or properties. The intention here is to add new verticals into the ICommunicationsClient using the same pattern without the ICommunicationsClient itself taking a dependency on the new vertical's nuget, which provides greater decoupling between future verticals we will support. For a usage example please see the ICommunicationsClient.Calls() extension method."
