    "keywords": "Notifications in Calling Refer to Registering a Calling Bot on how to register the callback URL. This callback is used for all incoming calls to the application. Protocol determination The incoming notification is provided in legacy format for compatibility with the previous protocol . In order to convert the call to the Microsoft Graph protocol, the bot must determine the notification is in legacy format and reply with: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content The application will again receive the notification but this time it will be in the Microsoft Graph protocol. You may configure the protocol your application supports and avoid receiving the initial callback in legacy format. The setting is available as a configuration option in the Skype Channel. Redirects for region affinity We will invoke your callback from the data-center hosting the call. The call may start in any data-center and does not take into account region affinities. The notification will be sent to your deployment depending on the GeoDNS resolution. If your application determines, by inspecting the initial notification payload or otherwise, that it needs to run in a different deployment, the application may reply with: HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: your-new-location You may decide to pickup the call and answer . You can specify the callback URL to handle this particular call. This is useful for stateful instances where your call is handled by a particular partition and you want to embed this information on the callback URL for routing to the right instance. Authenticating the callback Application should inspect the token passed by on the notification to validate the request. Whenever the API raises a web hook event, the API gets an OAUTH token from us, with audience as the application's App ID and adds it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. The application is expected to validate this token before accepting the callback request. POST https://bot.contoso.com/api/calls Content-Type: application/json Authentication: Bearer <TOKEN> \"value\": [ \"subscriptionId\": \"2887CEE8344B47C291F1AF628599A93C\", \"subscriptionExpirationDateTime\": \"2016-11-20T18:23:45.9356913Z\", \"changeType\": \"updated\", \"resource\": \"/app/calls/8A934F51F25B4EE19613D4049491857B\", \"resourceData\": { \"@odata.type\": \"#microsoft.graph.call\", \"state\": \"Established\" } ] The OAUTH token would have values like the following, and will be signed by us. The openid configuration published at https://api.aps.skype.com/v1/.well-known/OpenIdConfiguration can be used to verify the token. { \"aud\": \"0efc74f7-41c3-47a4-8775-7259bfef4241\", \"iss\": \"https://api.botframework.com\", \"iat\": 1466741440, \"nbf\": 1466741440, \"exp\": 1466745340, \"tid\": \"1fdd12d0-4620-44ed-baec-459b611f84b2\" } aud audience is the App ID URI specified for the application. tid is the tenant id for contoso iss is the token issuer, https://api.botframework.com The listener interface on the web hook URL can validate the token, ensure it has not expired, checking whether it has been signed by our published openid configuration.

    "title": "Registering a calling bot",
    "keywords": "Registering a calling bot In this topic you will learn how to register a new Calling Bot. Register your bot in the Azure Bot Service Complete the following steps: Register a bot by creating a Bot Channels Registration through Azure Bot Channel Registration . Once you complete the registration, take a note of the registered config values (Bot Name, Application Id, and Application Secret). You will need these values later in the code samples. In the resource blade, click Channels . Enable the Microsoft Teams channel and enable calling on the Calling tab. Fill in the Webhook (for calling) where you will receive incoming notifications. E.g. https://{your domain}/api/calls . Refer to Connect a bot to channels for more information on how to configure channels. Permissions Add Microsoft Graph permissions for calling to your bot Microsoft Graph exposes granular permissions controlling the access apps have to resources. As a developer, you decide which permissions for Microsoft Graph your app requests. The Microsoft Graph Communications Calling APIs support Application permissions, which are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or bots. Application permissions can only be consented by a tenant administrator. Calling bots and applications have some capabilties that will need tenant administrator consent. Below is a list of those permissions: Permission Display String Description Admin Consent Required Calls.Initiate.All Initiate outgoing 1:1 calls from the app (preview) Allows the app to place outbound calls to a single user and transfer calls to users in your organization's directory, without a signed-in user. Yes Calls.InitiateGroupCall.All Initiate outgoing group calls from the app (preview) Allows the app to place outbound calls to multiple users and add participants to meetings in your organization, without a signed-in user. Yes Calls.JoinGroupCall.All Join Group Calls and Meetings as an app (preview) Allows the app to join group calls and scheduled meetings in your organization, without a signed-in user. The app will be joined with the privileges of a directory user to meetings in your tenant. Yes Calls.JoinGroupCallasGuest.All Join Group Calls and Meetings as a guest (preview) Allows the app to anonymously join group calls and scheduled meetings in your organization, without a signed-in user. The app will be joined as a guest to meetings in your tenant. Yes Calls.AccessMedia.All *see below* Access media streams in a call as an app (preview) Allows the app to get direct access to participant media streams in a call, without a signed-in user. Yes Important: You may not use the Microsoft.Graph.Calls.Media API to record or otherwise persist media content from calls or meetings that your bot accesses. Assigning permissions You pre-configure the application permissions your app needs when you register your app. To add permissions from the Azure Bot Registration Portal: From the Settings blade, click Manage . This is the link appearing by the Microsoft App ID . This link will open a window where you can click on API permissions and then click Add a permission in the right pane. Select Microsoft Graph , choose Application Permissions and then select the permissions your app requires in the Select Permissions dialog. Getting administrator consent An administrator can either consent to these permissions using the Azure portal when your app is installed in their organization, or you can provide a sign-up experience in your app through which administrators can consent to the permissions you configured. Once administrator consent is recorded by Azure AD, your app can request tokens without having to request consent again. You can rely on an administrator to grant the permissions your app needs at the Azure portal , but often a better option is to provide a sign-up experience for administrators by using the Azure AD v2.0 /adminconsent endpoint. Please refer to the instructions on constructing an Admin Consent URL for more detail. Note : Constructing the Tenant Admin Consent URL requires a configured Redirect URI/Reply URL in the App Registration Portal . To add reply URLs for your bot, access your bot registration, choose Advanced Options > Edit Application Manifest. Add your Redirect URI to the field replyURLs. Important : Any time you make a change to the configured permissions, you must also repeat the Admin Consent process. Changes made in the app registration portal will not be reflected until consent has been reapplied by the tenant's administrator. Register bot in Microsoft Teams The code samples can be used in combination with a Microsoft Teams App Manifest settings to add the Calling and Video buttons for a 1:1 bot interaction. To develop calling bot, add 'supportsCalling' and 'supportsVideo' boolean properties to the bots section in the app manifest and the bot is all set to receive calls once installed (either to a personal context or a team). App Manifests can be uploaded through the App Studio in the Microsoft Teams client. In the Teams client, select Apps from the left pane and then select App Studio . From the top pane, click Manifest editor and then Create a new app from the left pane. In the App details tab, provide the basic information. And make sure to update App Id correctly. Navigate to the Capabilities section, and select the Bots tab. Then select Set Up in the right pane. Fill in the desired bot name Select the Select from one of my existing bots option, and find your bot from above in the dropdown. If the drop down does not contains the App Id of the Bot (to be installed), Or if the Select from one of my existing bots option is disabled, select the Connect to a different bot id and paste same App id, provided in App details tab earlier Check all options under Calling Bot and Scope Press Save"

Declaration AudioQualityOfExperienceData GetQualityOfExperienceData() Returns Type Description AudioQualityOfExperienceData Remarks The bot should fetch the QoE data no more than once every 30 seconds. To get accurate metrics, the bot should let media flow for at least 30 seconds before fetching the QoE data. Send(AudioMediaBuffer) Sends a frame of audio media, where a frame contains 20 milliseconds of audio content (PCM samples). Declaration void Send(AudioMediaBuffer buffer) Parameters Type Name Description AudioMediaBuffer buffer AudioMediaBuffer containing the frame of audio media to send. Remarks The application must create a concrete class which derives from the AudioMediaBuffer abstract class. The buffer object passed to the Send method is still potentially in-use after the method returns to the caller. The application must not free the buffer's frame data until the the buffer object's Dispose() method is invoked by the Media Platform. The application should be sending 50 frames of audio media per second with each frame containing 20 milliseconds of audio content. The AudioSocket must be enabled to send media via the AudioSocketSettings.StreamDirections property. SendDtmfTone(ToneId) Sends a DTMF tone. Declaration void SendDtmfTone(ToneId tone) Parameters Type Name Description ToneId tone The DTMF digit. Ranges from 0-16. Remarks Sending DTMF tone is only allowed if the AudioSocket is configured for sending media. SendDtmfTones(IEnumerable<ToneId>, Int32) Sends a sequence of DTMF tones with an optional delay between each tone. Declaration void SendDtmfTones(IEnumerable<ToneId> tones, int delayBetweenTonesInMilliseconds = -1) Parameters Type Name Description IEnumerable < ToneId > tones The list of DTMF digits to be sent. Ranges from 0-16. Int32 delayBetweenTonesInMilliseconds Delay (in milliseconds) between each DTMF tone sent. Remarks By default, the delay is set to -1 which picks a random time between 0 to 500 milliseconds. Events AudioMediaReceived If the application has configured the AudioSocket to receive media, this event is raised each time a frame of audio media is received, where a frame contains 20 milliseconds of audio content (PCM samples). Once the application has consumed the buffer, it must call the buffer's Dispose() method. Declaration event EventHandler<AudioMediaReceivedEventArgs> AudioMediaReceived Event Type Type Description EventHandler < AudioMediaReceivedEventArgs > Remarks The application must be able to handle at least 50 incoming audio buffers per second. Events are serialized, so only one event at a time is raised to the app. The event handler should return as quickly as possible; any time-consuming per-frame processing should be performed asynchronously from the event handler. AudioSendStatusChanged If the application has configured the AudioSocket to send media, this event is raised to inform the application when it may begin sending media and when it should stop. The application cannot send media before receiving a MediaSendStatusChanged event indicating the SendStatus is Started. Declaration event EventHandler<AudioSendStatusChangedEventArgs> AudioSendStatusChanged Event Type Type Description EventHandler < AudioSendStatusChangedEventArgs > DominantSpeakerChanged This event is raised when there is a change in the dominant speaker in the conference. If there is no dominant speaker in the conference, the CurrentDominantSpeaker argument in the event will have the value None (0xFFFFFFFF). Declaration event EventHandler<DominantSpeakerChangedEventArgs> DominantSpeakerChanged Event Type Type Description EventHandler < DominantSpeakerChangedEventArgs > MediaStreamFailure This event is raised if there is a network connection failure with the peer. To recover, the bot will need to start a new call or rejoin the meeting. Declaration event EventHandler<MediaStreamFailureEventArgs> MediaStreamFailure Event Type Type Description EventHandler < MediaStreamFailureEventArgs > ToneReceived This event is raised when the DTMF tone is received.

Declaration public IntPtr Data { get; protected set; } Property Value Type Description IntPtr Remarks For the H264 video format, Data points to the start code of the first NALU of the frame and the whole buffer contains all the NALUs of the frame in sequence separated by their start codes. The frame data is an unencrypted depacketized H.264 elementary stream. B frames and SEI messages are not supported. Supported NALU types are 7 (SPS), 8 (PPS), 5 (IDR), and 1 (non-IDR). NALU start code prefixes can be either 0x000001 (3 bytes) or 0x00000001 (4 bytes). Fragmentation and packetization of NALUs is automatically handled by the platform. When receiving video in the H264 format, the platform ensures the application always receives decodable, full frames. Length The length of data in the media buffer. Declaration public long Length { get; protected set; } Property Value Type Description Int64 MediaSourceId MediaSourceId (MSI) of the video buffer. Within group or conference video calls, the MSI value identifies the video media source. This property is populated by the Real-Time Media Platform for Bots on received video buffers. When sending buffers via the IVideoSocket.Send API, this property is unused. Declaration public uint MediaSourceId { get; protected set; } Property Value Type Description UInt32 OriginalVideoFormat Original VideoFormat of the buffer when it was sourced. It is only used when receiving video buffers via the IVideoSocket.VideoMediaReceived event handler, in which case the VideoMediaBuffer.VideoFormat property may have different Width and Height values than the OriginalVideoFormat property, which represents the original format of the buffer. The reason is that the buffer may have been resized before being transmitted, so the original Width and Height may have been resized. If the Width and Height properties of OriginalVideoFormat differ from the VideoFormat property, the consumer of the VideoMediaBuffer raised in the VideoMediaReceived event should resize the buffer to fit the OriginalVideoFormat size. When sending buffers via the IVideoSocket.Send API, this property should always be null. Declaration public VideoFormat OriginalVideoFormat { get; protected set; } Property Value Type Description VideoFormat Stride Stride of the video buffer. This property is optional when sourcing video buffers that are sent via the IVideoSocket.Send API. Stride (also called pitch) represents the number of bytes it takes to read one row of pixels in memory. It may differ from the width depending on the color format. Declaration public int Stride { get; protected set; } Property Value Type Description Int32 Timestamp Timestamp of when the media content was sourced, in 100-ns units. When sourcing media buffers, this property should be set using the value from the MediaPlatform.GetCurrentTimestamp() API. Declaration public long Timestamp { get; protected set; } Property Value Type Description Int64 VideoFormat VideoFormat of the video media buffer. Declaration public VideoFormat VideoFormat { get; protected set; } Property Value Type Description VideoFormat Methods Dispose() Disposes the object. Declaration public void Dispose() Dispose(Boolean) Releases unmanaged resources held by the buffer object. Must be implemented in the derived class.

At least one of the H264_320x180 video formats must be supported. For best video interoperability, the bot should support all the H264_320x180 formats. For the Vbss modality, all of the send formats must be of the same resolution. The resolution should best match the native resolution of the content to be shared. Downscaling the Vbss content to a lower resolution should be avoided (but may be necessary if the native content resolution is larger than 1080p). The bot should support as many different frame rates as possible. The 1.875 fps frame rate must be supported."

    "title": "Testing of Bots",
    "keywords": "Testing of Bots This document describes how to setup the Graph Communications Calling SDK to run on your localhost, run tests against it against the Graph Platform. Caution Do not use this testing setup for production traffic. Please limit it to debugging your bot locally with test traffic because of security concerns. Prerequisites The testing setup requires ngrok to create tunnels to localhost. Go to ngrok and sign up for a free account. Once you signed up, go to the dashboard and get your authtoken. Create an ngrok configuration file ngrok.yml with the following data authtoken: <Your-AuthToken> Tip Free ngrok account does not provide static tunnels. Tunnels change everytime a tunnel is created. So, if using free account, it is recommended to not close ngrok until it's use is completed. Tip Ngrok does not require sign up if you do not use TCP tunnels. Setting up Signaling In order for the platform to talk to your bot, the bot needs to be reached over the internet. So, an ngrok tunnel is created in http mode with an address pointing to a port on your localhost. Add the following lines to your ngrok config tunnels: signaling: addr: <Localhost Signaling Port> proto: http Setting up Application Hosted Media Note This section is only required for Application Hosted Media bots and can be skipped if you do not host media yourself. Application Hosted Media uses certificates and TCP tunnels to properly work. The following steps are required in order for proper media establishment. Ngrok's public TCP endpoints have fixed urls. They are 0.tcp.ngrok.io , 1.tcp.ngrok.io , etc. You should have a dns CNAME entry for your service that points to these urls. In this example, let's say 0.bot.contoso.com is pointing to 0.tcp.ngrok.io , and similarly for other urls. Now you require an SSL certificate for the url you own. To make it easy, use an SSL certificate issued to a wild card domain. In this case, it would be *.bot.contoso.com . This ssl certificate is validated by Media flow so should match your media flow's public url. Note down the thumbprint and install the certificate in your machine certificates. Now, we setup a TCP tunnel to forward the traffic to localhost. Write the following lines into your ngrok config. media: addr: <Localhost Media Port> proto: tcp Important Because ngrok's tcp urls can be same for multiple users (just differing in ports), it is possible for a third party to look like your service. This is a security issue. Therefore this document should be followed only for testing and also using a separate domain that is not linked to your production services. Start Ngok Now that ngrok configuration is ready, start it up. Download the ngrok executable and run the following command ngrok.exe start -all -config <Path to your ngrok.yml> This would start ngrok and provide you the public urls which provide the tunnels to your localhost. The output looks like the following Forwarding http://signal.ngrok.io -> localhost:12345 Forwarding https://signal.ngrok.io -> localhost:12345 Forwarding tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12332 -> localhost:8445 Here, 12345 is my signaling port, 8445 is the local media port and 12332 is the remote media port exposed by ngrok. Note that we have a forwarding from 1.bot.contoso.com to 1.tcp.ngrok.io . This will be used as the media url for bot. Update Code Once ngrok is up and running, we update the code to use the config we just setup. Update Signaling In the builder, change the NotficationUrl to the signaling url provided by ngrok. clientBuilder.SetNotificationUrl( new Uri(\"https://signal.ngrok.io/notificationEndpoint\")) Important Replace signal with the one provided by ngrok and the NotificationEndpoint with the controller path that receives notification. Important The url in SetNotificationUrl must be HTTPS. Important Your local instance must be listening to http traffic on the signaling port. The requests made by Graph Platform will reach the bot as localhost http traffic when End to End encryption is not setup. Update Media Update your MediaPlatformSettings to the following. var mediaPlatform = new MediaPlatformSettings { ApplicationId = <Your application id> MediaPlatformInstanceSettings = new MediaPlatformInstanceSettings { CertificateThumbprint = <Your SSL Cert thumbprint>, InstanceInternalPort = <Localhost media port>, InstancePublicPort = <Ngrok exposed remote media port>, InstancePublicIPAddress = new IPAddress(0x0), ServiceFqdn = <Media url for bot (eg: 1.bot.contoso.com)>, }, } Caution The Certificate Thumbprint provided above should match the Service FQDN. That is why the DNS entries are required. Caveats The free accounts of ngrok do NOT provide End to End encryption. The HTTPS data ends at the ngrok url and the data flows unencrypted from ngrok to localhost. You require paid ngrok account and configuration update to use End to End encryption. See ngrok docs for steps on setting up secure E2E tunnels. Because the bot callback url is dynamic, incoming call scenarios won't work as they are part of bot registration and they are static. One way to fix this is to use a paid ngrok account which provides fixed subdomains to which you can point your bot and the platform."

    "title": "Supporting Multiple Applications Within Single Code Base",
    "keywords": "Supporting Multiple Applications Within Single Code Base Some developers may wish to support multiple applications from within the same application code. With very little effort, this can be done using multiple instances of ICommunicationsClient . There are some steps that should be taken to ensure that we make outbound requests with the right application, and we forward incoming notifications to the right application. This writeup will demonstrate how to alter the existing samples to add multiple application support. We have not created a sample of this scenario explicitly given that it is not a standard way to use the Graph SDK. Create multiple communications clients First, each application instance requires it's own ICommunicationsClient instance, given that it supports a single IRequestAuthenticationProvider Let's change the Bot ICommunicationsClient Client to an IDictionary<string, ICommunicationsClient> Clients and create our clients. /// <summary> /// Prevents a default instance of the <see cref=\"Bot\"/> class from being created. /// </summary> private Bot() { this.AddClient( Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftAppId, Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftAppPassword); this.AddClient( Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftApp2Id, Service.Instance.Configuration.MicrosoftApp2Password); } private void AddClient(string appId, string appSecret) { // Create a unique notification uri for first app instance // This appends the app id to the callback uri so we get // https://base.uri/callbacks/{appId} var notificationUri = new Uri( Service.Instance.Configuration.CallControlBaseUrl, appId); var builder = new CommunicationsClientBuilder(\"AudioVideoPlaybackBot\", appId); builder .SetAuthenticationProvider( new AuthenticationProvider( appId, appSecret, Service.Instance.Configuration.TokenAudienceResourceLink)) .SetNotificationUrl(notificationUri) .SetMediaPlatformSettings(Service.Instance.Configuration.MediaPlatformSettings) .SetServiceBaseUrl(Service.Instance.Configuration.PlaceCallEndpointUrl); var client = builder.Build(); this.Clients.Add(appId, client); client.Calls().OnIncoming += this.CallsOnIncoming; client.Calls().OnUpdated += this.CallsOnUpdated; } /// <summary> /// Gets the contained app clients /// </summary> public IDictionary<string, ICommunicationsClient> Clients { get; } Let's also add a reference to the ICallCollection to the call handler for ease of access. This will allow us to reference the correct collection/client from any given call id. /// <summary> /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref=\"CallHandler\"/> class. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"callCollection\">The call collection.</param> /// <param name=\"call\">The call.</param> public CallHandler(ICallCollection callCollection, ICall call); /// <summary> /// Gets the call collection /// </summary> public ICallCollection CallCollection { get; } /// <summary> /// Gets the call /// </summary> public ICall Call { get; } Handle notifications Next we need to adjust the incoming call controller to forward the notifications to the right client. If there is no need to handle incoming call, then the above configuration will automatically route the the correct apps endpoint. If we need to handle incoming call, we can either have a default app process all those scenarios, or the callback URI of each app can contain the app id. For example, if our service URI is https://base.uri/callback , we can set all our bots to use this URI directly, but then we lose knowledge of which app is receiving the incoming call. If we change each app's callback URI to https://base.uri/callback/{appId} (example: https://base.uri/callback/9ecd52e5-6592-42b7-b562-093f37f13bde , where the appId is 9ecd52e5-6592-42b7-b562-093f37f13bde) then we have the app context when an incoming call occurs. Of course there are other ways to get the app ID, like from the auth token or the payload, but this is one simple option. To handle the app id in the URI the controllers for callbacks need to be changed to the following: /// <summary> /// Gets a reference to singleton sample bot/client instance /// </summary> private IDictionary<string, ICommunicationsClient> Clients => Bot.Instance.Clients; /// <summary> /// Handle a callback for an incoming call. /// Here we don't know what application is receiving the callback. /// </summary> /// <returns> /// The <see cref=\"HttpResponseMessage\"/>. /// </returns> [HttpPost] [Route(\"\")] public Task<HttpResponseMessage> OnIncomingRequestAsync() { // Pick some app id to handle this call. var appId = this.Clients.Keys.First(); return this.OnIncomingRequestAsync(appId); } /// <summary> /// Handle a callback for an incoming call or notification. /// Here we've added the application id to the callback URI. /// </summary> /// <returns> /// The <see cref=\"HttpResponseMessage\"/>. /// </returns> [HttpPost] [Route(\"{appId}\")] public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> OnIncomingRequestAsync(string appId) { Log.Info(new CallerInfo(), LogContext.FrontEnd, $\"Received HTTP {this.Request.Method}, {this.Request.RequestUri}\"); // Pass the incoming message to the sdk. The sdk takes care of what to do with it. var client = this.Clients[appId]; var response = await client.ProcessNotificationAsync(this.Request).ConfigureAwait(false); // Enforce the connection close to ensure that requests are evenly load balanced so // calls do no stick to one instance of the worker role. response.Headers.ConnectionClose = true; return response; } Additional notes There are a few items not addressed here. For instance, when a VTC joins a meeting, which app should it use? This has been purposefuly excluded from this guide given that it is unique business logic. Some may want a different bot configuration for each client, others may associate unique permissions to each bot and use depending on action being performed."

State Management The Graph Communications Calling SDK exposes a different set of APIs to manage states of resources in memory. Bots built using this SDK need to register event handlers for each newly created resource in order to be informed of any changes happening on that resource. The strengths and limitations of each are further explained in the State Management article. Media Session For calls with locally hosted media the ICallCollection has an extended AddAsync method which expects an IMediaSession object. This object contains the IAudioSocket and IVideoSocket composition. The IMediaSession also knows how to construct the MediaConfiguration required by the back end services to enable the AV stream to flow through the call instance. A Media Extension SDK has been added on top of this SDK to support locally hosted media scenarios. To use this extension the ICommunicationsClient must be built with MediaCommunicationsClientBuilderExtensions.SetMediaPlatformSettings . The MediaCommunicationsClientExtensions.CreateMediaSession extension method facilitates the creation of IMediaSession objects.

    "keywords": "State Management All states of resources associated with a Call in the Graph Communications Calling SDK are handled internally. The notifications and events for a particular ICall or a particular resource contained in ICall are always received on a single application instance. This means that the instance should be maintaining the state of a call in memory and a single ICall object exists throughout the duration of the call. These are called Stateful calls and the bots are called Stateful bots. The notification or events for any call can hit any instance of the application. This means that everytime a notification comes to an instance, a new Call object is created by the Graph Communications Calling Core SDK and is destroyed once the notification/event has been handled. Any state required for the call should be maintained by the bot logic. These type of bots are called Stateless bots signifying that the Graph Communications Calling Core SDK itself does not maintain any state for the bot. Differences Between Stateless and Stateful Bots The major difference between Stateless and Stateful bots is that maintaining Stateful bots requires that the bot instance would not go down when a call is in progress. If the instance goes down, the call object is lost and no notifications or events are received by the Graph Communications Calling SDK and the calls gets dropped by the server. On the contrast, in Stateless bots, even if the bot instance goes down, the events and notifications go to the other instances of the bot and the bot can continue its logic. Important In Application Hosted Media Calls , the media is handled by a single instance of the bot. Therefore, all the notifications should reach the same instance of the bot for signaling of the media to be properly handled. Thus stateless scenarios for Application Hosted Media bots are not supported."

    "title": "Graph Communications Bot Media SDK",
    "keywords": "Graph Communications Bot Media SDK The Real-time Media Platform enables bots to interact with Microsoft Teams calls and meetings using real-time voice, video and screen sharing. This is an advanced capability which allows the bot to send and receive voice and video content frame by frame. The bot has \"raw\" access to the voice, video and screen sharing media streams. (Bots which process media themselves are called application-hosted media bots, as opposed to simpler service-hosted media bots that rely on the Real-time Media platform for all media processing.) For example, in a 1:1 call with a bot, as the user speaks, the bot will receive 50 audio frames per second, with each frame containing 20 milliseconds (ms) of audio. An application-hosted media bot can perform real-time speech recognition as the audio frames are received, rather than having to wait for a recording after the user has stopped speaking. The bot can also send and receive high-definition-resolution video, including video-based screen sharing content. The platform provides a simple \"socket\"-like API for the bot to send and receive media, and handles the real-time encoding and decoding of audio/video packets, using codecs such as SILK and G.722 for audio and H.264 for video. The platform also handles all media packet encryption/decryption and packet network transmission automatically, so the bot just needs to concern itself with the actual audio/video content. A real-time media bot may participate in 1:1 calls as well as meetings with multiple participants. Microsoft Real-Time Media Platform for Bots API (\"Media Access API\") Accompanying Documentation The Media Access API is offered under the terms of the Microsoft APIs Terms of Use ( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use ) and this accompanying documentation. \"Media Access API\" means (i) any form of machine accessible application programming interface that Microsoft makes publicly available which provides access to a Microsoft Offering that includes media content (e.g., audio or video), including all associated tools, elements, components and executables therein, (ii) any Microsoft sample code that enables interactions with a Microsoft Offering, and (iii) documentation that Microsoft makes available to help enable your access to the Media Access API. Additional Restriction : You may NOT use the Media Access API to record or otherwise persist media content from calls or meetings that your Application accesses, or data derived from that media content.

This socket ID is useful to identify a socket in a multiview (ie. more than 1 video socket) call. The same ID is used in the event args of the VideoMediaReceived and VideoSendStatusChanged events that this class may raise. The socket ID property will be present in both single view and multiview cases. The ID maps to the order in which the video sockets are provided to the CreateMediaConfiguration API. Eg., if the collection of IVideoSocket objects in the CreateMediaConfiguration API contains {socketA, socketB, socketC}, the sockets will have the ID mapping of: 0 for socketA, 1 for socketB and 2 for socketC.

Declaration void Send(VideoMediaBuffer buffer) Parameters Type Name Description VideoMediaBuffer buffer VideoMediaBuffer containing the frame of video media to send. Remarks The application must create a concrete class which derives from the VideoMediaBuffer abstract class. The buffer object passed to the Send method is still potentially in-use after the method returns to the caller. The application must not free the buffer's data until the the buffer object's Dispose() method is invoked by the Media Platform. The application should be sending up to 30 video frames per second. The VideoSocket must be enabled to send media via the VideoSocketSettings.StreamDirections property. SetReceiveBandwidthLimit(UInt32) Sets the bandwidth limit on the receive stream of the VideoSocket. This is only supported if the socket supports receiving H264 video format. It is recommended to wait for the VideoReceiveStatusChanged event with MediaReceiveStatus Active state during the initial call setup before applying the receive bandwidth limit on the socket.

Declaration void Subscribe(VideoResolution preferredVideoResolution) Parameters Type Name Description VideoResolution preferredVideoResolution The requested video resolution. The received video frames should have this resolution if the bandwidth constraints and sender capabilities allow, however the bot may receive video frames at a resolution lower than requested. Subscribe(VideoResolution, UInt32) Request to receive the video source of a participant in a meeting or group call. The video source must be identified by its MediaSourceId available from the roster. The bot cannot subscribe to a video source unless the VideoReceiveStatusChanged event is raised indicating the VideoSocket's MediaReceiveStatus is Active .

InvalidOperationException Thrown if the subscription is invalid. SkypeMediaException Thrown if an internal media failure occurs. Unsubscribe() Stops the current video subscription on the VideoSocket. The VideoMediaReceived events will stop raising video buffers. Declaration void Unsubscribe() UpdateVideoSendCapability(VideoSendCapability) Updates the send capabilities (such as SupportedSendVideoFormats or MaxConcurrentSendStreams) of the video socket, allowing the bot to add and remove video formats mid-call. Declaration void UpdateVideoSendCapability(VideoSendCapability capability) Parameters Type Name Description VideoSendCapability capability Events MediaStreamFailure This event is raised if there is a network connection failure with the peer. To recover, the bot will need to start a new call or rejoin the meeting. Declaration event EventHandler<MediaStreamFailureEventArgs> MediaStreamFailure Event Type Type Description EventHandler < MediaStreamFailureEventArgs > Remarks Note: this event can be raised even if there is no active video subscription; i.e., the VideoSocket is \"idle\" and not receiving media.

Once the application has consumed the buffer, it must call the buffer's Dispose() method. Declaration event EventHandler<VideoMediaReceivedEventArgs> VideoMediaReceived Event Type Type Description EventHandler < VideoMediaReceivedEventArgs > Remarks The incoming video frame rate is variable. The frame rate can vary between 1.875 frames per second (fps) up to 30 fps. The application must be able to receive up to 30 video buffers per second. Events are serialized, so only one event at a time is raised to the app. The event handler should return as quickly as possible; any time-consuming per-frame processing should be performed asynchronously from the event handler. VideoReceiveStatusChanged If the application has configured the VideoSocket to receive media, this event is raised to inform the application when it is ready to receive media. When the status is active the application can subscribe to a video source, when inactive video subscription won't be allowed Declaration event EventHandler<VideoReceiveStatusChangedEventArgs> VideoReceiveStatusChanged Event Type Type Description EventHandler < VideoReceiveStatusChangedEventArgs > VideoSendStatusChanged If the application has configured the VideoSocket to send media, this event is raised to inform the application when it may begin sending media and when it should stop. The application cannot send media before receiving a VideoMediaSendStatusChanged event indicating the SendStatus is Active, such media will be discarded.

The same ID is used in the event args of the VideoMediaReceived and VideoSendStatusChanged events that this class may raise. The socket ID property will be present in both single view and multiview cases. The ID maps to the order in which the video sockets are provided to the CreateMediaConfiguration API. Eg., if the collection of IVideoSocket objects in the CreateMediaConfiguration API contains {socketA, socketB, socketC}, the sockets will have the ID mapping of: 0 for socketA, 1 for socketB and 2 for socketC.

To get accurate metrics, the bot should let media flow for at least 30 seconds before fetching the QoE data. RequestKeyFrame() Allows the application to request for key frame. Only valid for sockets with the ReceiveColorFormat as H264 Declaration public void RequestKeyFrame() Send(VideoMediaBuffer) Sends a frame of video media. Declaration public void Send(VideoMediaBuffer buffer) Parameters Type Name Description VideoMediaBuffer buffer VideoMediaBuffer containing the frame of video media to send. Remarks The application must create a concrete class which derives from the VideoMediaBuffer abstract class. The buffer object passed to the Send method is still potentially in-use after the method returns to the caller. The application must not free the buffer's data until the the buffer object's Dispose() method is invoked by the Media Platform. The application should be sending up to 30 video frames per second. The VideoSocket must be enabled to send media via the VideoSocketSettings.StreamDirections property. SetReceiveBandwidthLimit(UInt32) Sets the bandwidth limit on the receive stream of the VideoSocket. This is only supported if the socket supports receiving H264 video format. It is recommended to wait for the VideoReceiveStatusChanged event with MediaReceiveStatus Active state during the initial call setup before applying the receive bandwidth limit on the socket.

Declaration public void Subscribe(VideoResolution preferredVideoResolution) Parameters Type Name Description VideoResolution preferredVideoResolution The requested video resolution. The received video frames should have this resolution if the bandwidth constraints and sender capabilities allow, however the bot may receive video frames at a resolution lower than requested. Subscribe(VideoResolution, UInt32) Request to receive the video source of a participant in a meeting or group call. The video source must be identified by its MediaSourceId available from the roster. The bot cannot subscribe to a video source unless the VideoReceiveStatusChanged event is raised indicating the VideoSocket's MediaReceiveStatus is Active . Declaration public void Subscribe(VideoResolution preferredVideoResolution, uint MediaSourceId) Parameters Type Name Description VideoResolution preferredVideoResolution The requested video resolution. The received video frames should have this resolution if the bandwidth constraints and sender capabilities allow, however the bot may receive video frames at a resolution lower than requested.

InvalidOperationException Thrown if the subscription is invalid. SkypeMediaException Thrown if an internal media failure occurs. Unsubscribe() Stops the current video subscription on the VideoSocket. The VideoMediaReceived events will stop raising video buffers. Declaration public void Unsubscribe() UpdateVideoSendCapability(VideoSendCapability) Allows the application to update dynamically the send capability (such as SupportedSendVideoFormats or MaxConcurrentSendStreams) of the video socket. The purpose of this API is to allow the application to communicate changes in VideoSocket's send capability to the platform during the call. Declaration public void UpdateVideoSendCapability(VideoSendCapability capability) Parameters Type Name Description VideoSendCapability capability Events MediaStreamFailure This event is raised if there is a network connection failure with the peer. To recover, the bot will need to start a new call or rejoin the meeting. Declaration public event EventHandler<MediaStreamFailureEventArgs> MediaStreamFailure Event Type Type Description EventHandler < MediaStreamFailureEventArgs > Remarks Note: this event can be raised even if there is no active video subscription; i.e., the VideoSocket is \"idle\" and not receiving media. MediaStreamQualityChanged The event is raised if a media stream quality change was detected Declaration public event EventHandler<VideoMediaStreamQualityChangedEventArgs> MediaStreamQualityChanged Event Type Type Description EventHandler < VideoMediaStreamQualityChangedEventArgs > VideoKeyFrameNeeded If the application has configured the VideoSocket to receive encoded media, this event is raised each time a key frame is needed. Events are serialized, so only one event at a time is raised to the app. Declaration public event EventHandler<VideoKeyFrameNeededEventArgs> VideoKeyFrameNeeded Event Type Type Description EventHandler < VideoKeyFrameNeededEventArgs > VideoMediaReceived If the application has configured the VideoSocket to receive media, this event is raised each time a frame of video media is received. Once the application has consumed the buffer, it must call the buffer's Dispose() method. Declaration public event EventHandler<VideoMediaReceivedEventArgs> VideoMediaReceived Event Type Type Description EventHandler < VideoMediaReceivedEventArgs > Remarks The incoming video frame rate is variable. The frame rate can vary between 1.875 frames per second (fps) up to 30 fps. The application must be able to receive up to 30 video buffers per second. Events are serialized, so only one event at a time is raised to the app. The event handler should return as quickly as possible; any time-consuming per-frame processing should be performed asynchronously from the event handler. VideoReceiveStatusChanged If the application has configured the VideoSocket to receive media, this event is raised to inform the application when it is ready to receive media. When the status is active the application can subscribe to a video source, when inactive video subscription won't be allowed Declaration public event EventHandler<VideoReceiveStatusChangedEventArgs> VideoReceiveStatusChanged Event Type Type Description EventHandler < VideoReceiveStatusChangedEventArgs > VideoSendStatusChanged If the application has configured the VideoSocket to send media, this event is raised to inform the application when it may begin sending media and when it should stop. The application cannot send media before receiving a VideoMediaSendStatusChanged event indicating the SendStatus is Active, such media will be discarded.

Declaration public void Send(AudioMediaBuffer buffer) Parameters Type Name Description AudioMediaBuffer buffer AudioMediaBuffer containing the frame of audio media to send. Remarks The application must create a concrete class which derives from the AudioMediaBuffer abstract class. The buffer object passed to the Send method is still potentially in-use after the method returns to the caller. The application must not free the buffer's frame data until the the buffer object's Dispose() method is invoked by the Media Platform.

    "keywords": "Graph Communications Calling SDK Introduction The Graph Communications Calling SDK simplifies the creation of calling and meetings bots that use the Cloud Communications APIs . The SDK provides the functionality to manage states of resources in memory and simplify tasks like call setup and media session establishment. It provides interfaces for bot's service-to-service interactions with calls and meetings, including an optional Media Extension SDK that enables a bot developer to host media on their machines and gain access to low level Audio/Video sockets and media streams. SDK The Graph Communications Calling SDK is built on top of the Microsoft Graph API and distributed as NuGet packages. The Core Concepts article is designed to better explain all the constructs used by the SDKs. To dive right in and deploy a Calling Bot refer to the documentation in each sample for further instructions. The SDK is divided into multiple nuget packages each described as below. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Common ( nuget ): This is the nuget containing all the utilities used throughout the Stateful SDK. It contains telemetry, http, obfuscation support along with helper methods. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Core ( nuget ): This library contains the serialization and notification for the communications APIs. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Client ( nuget ): This is the base client for the Stateful SDK. This implements all the common SDK features used within different verticals like calling, etc. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls ( nuget ): This is the SDK that implements calling APIs. This supports making, receiving, and joining calls with Microsoft Teams users, and creating voice and video enabled bots. Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media ( nuget ): This library allows developers to use the Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls SDK and gain direct access to the audio, video, screen sharing, and data streams. This is an optional library on top of Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls Microsoft.Skype.Bots.Media ( nuget ): The Real-Time Media Platform for Bots adds a new dimension to how bots can interact with users: by enabling real-time voice, video and screen sharing modalities. Concepts and Examples For more details on concepts used by the SDK and examples on joining calls and receiving calls please refer to the concepts and examples page. You can find samples using the following service: Stateful bot using Application Hosted Media on Azure Cloud Service Stateful bot using Application Hosted Media on Azure Service Fabric Stateful bot using Service Hosted Media running on Azure App Service . ICommunicationsClient and Extension Methods The Stateful SDK is exposed using a single class ICommunicationsClient . This class is defined in the Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Client nuget and has no dependency on the Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls calling vertical nuget package. The different verticals therefore make heavy usage of extension methods on ICommunicationsClient rather than standalone functions or properties. The intention here is to add new verticals into the ICommunicationsClient using the same pattern without the ICommunicationsClient itself taking a dependency on the new vertical's nuget, which provides greater decoupling between future verticals we will support. For a usage example please see the ICommunicationsClient.Calls() extension method. Accompanying Information Accessing the Microsoft Teams Service through a Microsoft API Cloud Video Interop (CVI) partners and contact centers may integrate with Microsoft Teams to aid their solution. Contact centers may route calls to Microsoft Teams but may not build a separate or independent communications related solution while using Microsoft Teams as a base for the solution."

    "title": "Graph Core and Communications SDK Concepts",
    "keywords": "Graph Core and Communications SDK Concepts The Graph signaling SDK is quite flexible and can run in multiple environments, and support both stateful and stateless architectures. It can run on Azure Cloud Service , Azure Service Fabric , and Azure App Service . Furthermore, because the SDK supports both .net framework 4.6.1+ and netstandard 2.0 it is cross platform . This article describes the key concepts in order to effectively utilize the Graph Core SDK and the Graph Communications SDK including the Calling SDK. Graph Communications Core SDK The GraphServiceClient object is the entry point to the Graph Core SDK. The majority of the Graph Core SDK is automatically generated by the Graph SDK generator using the OData resource model. It reflects the REST-ful wire protocol provided by the Graph Communications service. Graph Communications Stateful SDK and Client Builder The ICommunicationsClient object is the entry point to the Graph Communications SDK and the Calling SDK. This SDK is designed for stateful services and provides additional support on top of the Graph Core SDK for resource state management and media management. The ICommunicationsClientBuilder is the object used to construct a new ICommunicationsClient with the desired settings. Building media bots has additional considerations which are further outlined in the media section . Notification Dispatching Notifications for root collections, such as the ICallCollection generated by ICommunicationsClient.Calls() , are handled in a single queue. Any root resource, such as the ICall , that has been added to the root collection is given it's own queue. Any child resources, of the root resource, such as the ICallParticipant use the same queue as the root resource. Each queue will delivered event callbacks to the developer sequentially. The SDK will wait to deliver the next event callbacks until all the callbacks for the current event have been processed. This has been done as to help developers avoid concurrency issues and will in the future support resource versioning and jitter buffers. Important It is important for all event handlers to be non-blocking, and any long running operations need to be offloaded to another thread. Long running operations in any event will block further operations from being raised for the given resource. Example Outgoing Calls To illustrate functionality of the Graph Communications Calling SDK, the below examples demonstrate 2 common scenarios: how to make an outbound call to a Microsoft Teams user and how to join an existing Microsoft Teams meeting. Making an Outbound Call Assuming a bot has been properly registered and deployed, the ICommunicationsClient configured and built. The bot needs to create the Call object with the corresponding parameters and pass the object to the CallCollectionExtensions.AddAsync method as follows: Call callResource = new Call { Subject = \"**Subject**\", Targets = new List<InvitationParticipantInfo> { new InvitationParticipantInfo { Identity = new IdentitySet { User = new Identity { Id = \"**Target's AAD ObjectId GUID**\" }, }, } }, TenantId = \"**The id of the tenant that will host the meeting**\" }; IMediaSession mediaSession = this.Client.CreateMediaSession(**media session settings**); ICall call = await this.Client.Calls().AddAsync(callResource, mediaSession); SDK will store the state of the call in memory after calling AddAsync . The returned call object above contains the call Id set by the service. Making an Outbound Call to Join an Existing Microsoft Teams Meeting The above example shows how to create an outbound call to single or multiple participants and create a new conversation. If the bot needs to join an existing conversation, the SDK provides an overload of AddAsync that takes JoinMeetingParameters as input. The bot needs to create the JoinMeetingParameters object with the corresponding meeting parameters and pass the object to the CallCollectionExtensions.AddAsync method as follows: ChatInfo chatInfo = new ChatInfo { MessageId = \"**Message Id**\", ThreadId = \"**Thread Id**\", ReplyChainMessageId = \"**Reply Chain Message Id**\" }; OrganizerMeetingInfo meetingInfo = new OrganizerMeetingInfo { Organizer = new IdentitySet { User = new Identity { Id = \"**Meeting Organizer's AAD ObjectId GUID**\" }, } }; meetingInfo.Organizer.User.SetTenantId(\"**TenantId Guid**\"); IMediaSession mediaSession = this.Client.CreateMediaSession(**media session settings**); JoinMeetingParameters joinCallParameters = new JoinMeetingParameters( chatInfo, meetingInfo, mediaSession); ICall call = await this.Client.Calls().AddAsync(joinCallParameters); SDK will store the state of the call in memory after calling AddAsync . The returned call object above contains the callId set by the service. Example Incoming Calls Any time another user or bot places a call to your bot, you will receive a notification to the global application endpoint specified when registering your bot. Incoming call scenarios are supported with both Service Hosted Media and App Hosted Media configurations. Important For all incoming call scenarios, the initial incoming call notification will still be received using the BotBuilder protocol. The Graph SDK automatically returns 204 No Content to the initial notification to invoke the new Graph protocol. Answering incoming call with application hosted media First, subscribe to incoming calls. this.Client.Calls().OnIncoming += this.CallsOnIncoming; When incoming call comes, the bot needs to answer with an IMediaSession . This can be a media session created using the ICommunicationsClient.CreateMediaSession() extension or a custom IMediaSession . private void CallsOnIncoming(ICallCollection sender, CollectionEventArgs<ICall> collectionEventArgs) { IMediaSession mediaSession = this.Client.CreateMediaSession( new AudioSocketSettings { StreamDirections = StreamDirection.Recvonly, SupportedAudioFormat = AudioFormat.Pcm16K }, new VideoSocketSettings { StreamDirections = StreamDirection.Sendrecv, ReceiveColorFormat = VideoColorFormat.NV12, SupportedSendVideoFormats = new List<VideoFormat> { VideoFormat.NV12_720x1280_30Fps, VideoFormat.NV12_1280x720_30Fps } } ); // Run async as not to block subsequent notifications. Task.Run(async () => { await collectionEventArgs .AddedResources .FirstOrDefault() .AnswerAsync(mediaSession) .ConfigureAwait(false); }); } Answer incoming call with service hosted media First subscribe to incoming calls. this.Client.Calls().OnIncoming += this.CallsOnIncoming; When incoming call comes, the bot will answer with a ServiceHostedMediaConfig . private void CallsOnIncoming(ICallCollection sender, CollectionEventArgs<ICall> collectionEventArgs) { // Run async as not to block subsequent notifications. Task.Run(async () => { await collectionEventArgs .AddedResources .FirstOrDefault() .AnswerAsync(new Modality[] { Modality.Audio }) .ConfigureAwait(false); }); } State Management Graph Communications SDK can be used to store state of all resources in memory. This has 2 implications: The instance hosting the call needs to be up throughout the lifetime of a call. Any subsequent asynchronous notifications delivered by the service need to be redirected to the instance hosting the call. Any bot that hosts its own media stack should to be built using the Graph Communications SDK given that the media stream has a requirement that it needs to persist in memory throughout the lifetime of the call. More details can be found in the State Management article."

Authentication Provider All calls made and received by the SDK must be authenticated by the bot developers. The SDK requires the developers to implement the IRequestAuthenticationProvider interface and specify it when building the ICommunicationsClient . There are two parts to the interface. AuthenticateOutboundRequestAsync : This method should add the Authorization header to the outbound HTTP requests from the SDK. AuthenticateOutboundRequestAsync : This method should validate the Authorization header for incoming HTTP requests from Graph, extract the Tenant ID from that header and provide it to the SDK. Examples of the Authentication Provider can be found in samples . Notification Handling The Graph Platform sends out notifications via HTTP that need to be handled by the Bot Developers. The Platform sends out notifications on the notification url, and the bot developers should listen to HTTP messages on that url. Once the HTTP message has been received by the developer, they need to forward the message to ICommunicationsClient using the ProcessNotificationAsync method. The SDK processes the notification, calls the IRequestAuthenticationProvider and raises any corresponding events asynchronously. The SDK then returns a HttpResponseMessage that needs to be sent out as a response to the Graph Platform. Note Developers using ASP.NET Core should convert the HttpRequest object into HttpRequestMessage before passing it to the SDK. Also, they need to convert the resulting HttpResponseMessage into HttpResponse .

GraphHttpClientContainer This class is used to handle multiple http clients within one service. This class extends the concurrent dictionary and contains a mapping from a key for the client to the http client itself. GraphHttpClientFactory The HTTP graph client factory. GraphProperty The IGraphProperty helpers and extensions. GraphRequest GraphRequest<T> The base of the exchange of a IGraphRequest<T> or IGraphResponse<T> . GraphRequestExtensions Extensions for IGraphRequest<T> class. GraphResponse GraphResponse<T> The base of the exchange of a IGraphRequest<T> or IGraphResponse<T> . GraphResponseException Class representing GraphResponseException GraphResponseExtensions Extensions for IGraphResponse<T> class. HttpRequestMessageExtensions Extensions for HttpRequestMessage . HttpResponseMessageExtensions Extensions for HttpResponseMessage class. NoContentMessage IGraphClient requires type parameters for functionality. This is a marked Type/class to make function calls to IGraphClient indicating we have request/response with no body. The sole purpose of this class's existence is to reduce code duplicacy. Structs GraphProperty<T> Interfaces IGraphClient This class abstracts any communication with different services. This client acts at an object level rather than wire level and thus providing richer experience when working with complex objects. IGraphClientFactory Interface for factory of IGraphClient . IGraphExchange The base of the exchange of a IGraphRequest<T> or IGraphResponse<T> . IGraphExchange<T> The base of the exchange of a IGraphRequest<T> or IGraphResponse<T> . IGraphHttpClient Interface for Http transport client. Gives us a way to work with different instances of GraphClient through Dependency Injection. IGraphProperty The graph property containing request or response data. IGraphProperty<T> IGraphRequest The request object used by the graph sdk. IGraphRequest<T> The request object with content. IGraphResponse The response got in exchange of a IGraphRequest . IGraphResponse<T> The response got in exchange of a IGraphRequest<T> . Enums RequestType Type of request that we want to issue on the transport ResponseStatus Different status of IGraphResponse<T> ."
